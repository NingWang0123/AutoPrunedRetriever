    "answer": "The Second Minnesota played a pivotal role in the Union's efforts, most notably distinguishing itself as the heroes of the decisive Battle of Mill Springs—the first major Union victory of the Civil War. Their valor on the battlefield not only earned them the admiration of their fellow Minnesotans, whose pride swelled at the regiment's achievements, but also drew the attention and congratulations of President Lincoln himself. Beyond Mill Springs, the Second Minnesota was integral to the Union forces, answering the call to arms with such enthusiasm that their numbers exceeded the initial requirements, and their presence became a symbol of Minnesota's deep commitment to the Union cause.",
