Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. \n\nWhat is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. \n\nSkin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. \n\nSkin basics Did you know that your skin is your body's largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: \n\nEpidermis The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). \nDermis The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. \nHypodermis The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. \n\nMost skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: \n- Squamous cells: These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. \n- Basal cells: Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin's surface. \n- Melanocytes: Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin. Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin, and eye color. It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. \n\nThis book is only about basal cell skin cancer. For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. \n\nSigns and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it's most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes. In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: \n- Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar \n- Red patches that might be itchy \n- Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas \n- Open sores that don't heal and might bleed, or go away and come back \n\nIn darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. \n\nCauses and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You're more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure — UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk."
