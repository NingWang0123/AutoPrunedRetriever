        "ground_truth": "According to the chroniclers' vivid accounts, the caves of the Yucatan Peninsula are remarkable for their hidden streams and inexhaustible springs of clear, cold water, often inhabited by shrimps and fishes whose origins and destinations remain mysterious. These subterranean waters provide rare and precious sources of life in a landscape otherwise devoid of surface rivers or lakes. The caves themselves are adorned with dramatic stalactites and stalagmites, and serve as natural outlets for escaping gases. Surrounding these caves, the lowlands have given rise to lakes and sloughs, while the dense forests above offer sanctuary to sea birds and water fowls. The roots of trees, in their desperate search for water, can be seen plunging down the sheer brinks of the senotes, sometimes reaching a hundred feet to touch the hidden waters below, illustrating the profound and intricate relationship between the caves and the living world around them.",

        "ground_truth": "The ancient Egyptian sistrum was a striking instrument, crafted from bronze or brass and designed with both function and ornamentation in mind. Its frame held three or four loosely inserted metal bars\u2014sometimes shaped like snakes or ending in the head of a goose\u2014which produced a distinctive jingling sound when shaken. To enhance its resonance, metal rings were often strung along the bars. The frame itself was sometimes adorned with the figure of a cat, adding a touch of sacred symbolism to its appearance. This combination of materials and decorative features made the sistrum not only a musical instrument, but also a richly symbolic object in Egyptian religious ceremonies.",
