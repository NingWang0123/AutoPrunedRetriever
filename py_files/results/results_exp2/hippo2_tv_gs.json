\" the phrase has been used in related projects and spin - offs, such as in 1981's unsuccessful pilot for \" k - 9 and company \", wherein the fourth doctor's robotic dog, k - 9, is discovered by his former companion, sarah jane smith, and describes itself as being a gift to her from \" the doctor \". supporting character brendan richards asks, \" who's the doctor? \", to which k - 9 replies with its catchphrase, \" affirmative. \" it has also been parodied within the show, such as in the 2013 episode \" hide \", wherein a character responds to the doctor's introduction with \" doctor what? \" the story arc running throughout the tenure of the eleventh doctor involved the oldest question in the universe, revealed in \" the wedding of river song \" to be \" doctor who? \", giving the phrase in - universe significance. in \" the name of the doctor \", the doctor's real name was revealed to be the password used to enter the doctor's tomb following his death on the planet trenzalore. the story arc was resolved\n434:. in \" nightmare in silver \", the collective consciousness of the cybermen informs the doctor that he could be reconstructed from the \" hole \" \u2013 the missing records \u2013 that he has left behind, a mistake which the doctor intends to rectify. few individuals are said to know the doctor's true name. river song whispered something to the tenth doctor to make him trust her during \" silence in the library \" / \" forest of the dead \", confirmed to have been his name towards the end of \" forest of the dead \". the events of \" the time of the doctor \" make it clear that his people, the time lords, know his true name, despite referring to him by his chosen alias as \" the doctor \", even in formal settings such as court. although listed in the on - screen credits for nearly twenty years as \" doctor who \" or \" dr who \", the doctor is seldom called by that name in the programme, except in a tongue - in - cheek manner. for example, in \" the gunfighters \" the doctor assumes the name of doctor caligari and subsequently responds to the question \" doctor who?
