        "ground_truth": "Young ungulates are particularly vulnerable to predators shortly after birth due to their undeveloped legs, making them unable to run quickly. However, even after developing running abilities, they can still be pursued by predators well into summer or fall. Conversely, adult ungulates are more likely to be attacked when they exhibit some form of physical disadvantage, highlighting that physical capabilities and disadvantages play a crucial role in their vulnerability to predation at different life stages.",
        "generated_answer": "The physical capabilities of ungulates, such as speed and agility, significantly influence their vulnerability to predation at various life stages.

        "question": "How does the altitudinal adaptability of brown bears influence their habitat preferences and behavior in different environments?",
        "ground_truth": "Brown bears' ability to thrive from sea level to 5000 m indicates a high level of adaptability, which may allow them to exploit diverse habitats. However, their preference for semiopen country with scattered vegetation suggests that while they can occupy a range of altitudes, they favor environments that provide resting spots during the day, demonstrating a balance between adaptability and habitat preference.",
        "generated_answer": "The altitudinal adaptability of brown bears allows them to thrive in diverse environments, influencing their habitat preferences by enabling them to occupy various altitudes. This adaptability also affects their behavior, as they may exhibit different foraging and territorial displays based on the specific ecological conditions of each environment.",
