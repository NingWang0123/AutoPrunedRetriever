    "question_type": "Complex Reasoning",
    "generated_answer": "Female philopatry in brown bear populations leads to localized breeding, which can result in reduced mitochondrial DNA variation due to limited gene flow between populations. This effect is particularly pronounced in regions where mating seasons are synchronized, as it reinforces the genetic structure and differentiation among geographically isolated groups.",

The mating season timing, which shifts later in northern populations, is also affected by local environmental conditions, further influencing genetic diversity and adaptation.",
