        "generated_answer": "To confirm the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma in a 28-year-old patient with painless cervical lymphadenopathy, initiate a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history and physical examination. Perform imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans to assess lymph node involvement and staging. A biopsy of the lymph node is essential for histological examination to differentiate between classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), focusing on the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells and the cellular composition. Immunohistochemical staining can further aid in distinguishing NLPHL from CHL, as NLPHL typically shows a predominance of lymphocytes and lacks the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells found in CHL.",

Primary cutaneous lymphoma (PCL), specifically cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL), is highly suspected given the presentation and lack of systemic symptoms. CBCL arises from B lymphocytes and is classified as a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) manifesting in the skin. Differential diagnoses include other forms of PCL, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). To confirm the diagnosis, I recommend a comprehensive workup including a thorough skin exam, blood tests to assess for systemic involvement, imaging tests to rule out extracutaneous disease, and skin biopsy with immunophenotyping to characterize the lymphocyte lineage. Assessment of biomarkers and genetic changes should be performed to further subtype the lymphoma, distinguishing between PCMZL, PCFCL, and PC-DLBCL, leg type. Most primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas are indolent, but aggressive variants must be ruled out.",

Diagnosis is established by detecting either the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene, typically via cytogenetic and molecular testing of blood or bone marrow samples. The disease originates in blood stem cells, leading to excessive production of myeloid progenitor cells and increased granulocyte (white blood cell) counts, often accompanied by abnormal platelet levels.

A skin biopsy with immunophenotyping should be performed to confirm lymphoid lineage, and additional testing for biomarkers and genetic changes may help classify the subtype (e.g., PCMZL, PCFCL, or PC-DLBCL, leg type). Early identification is essential for optimal management.",

        "ground_truth": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor of the adrenal cortex, most common in children under 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. It often presents with symptoms of hormone excess such as weight gain, muscle weakness, and stretch marks. Diagnosis involves imaging (CT, MRI, PET), blood and biochemical tests, genetic evaluation, and sometimes biopsy. Hereditary syndromes like Li-Fraumeni and MEN1/2 increase risk. Pheochromocytoma arises from the adrenal medulla, presenting with high blood pressure, headache, rapid heartbeat, and sweating. Diagnosis relies on CT/MRI and biochemical tests. Neuroblastoma mainly affects children under 5, may metastasize to bones, and is diagnosed with imaging and biochemical tests. Family history and hereditary syndromes are important risk factors for all three.",
