To enhance its resonance, metal rings were often strung along the bars. The frame itself was sometimes adorned with the figure of a cat, adding a touch of sacred symbolism to its appearance.

These subterranean waters provide rare and precious sources of life in a landscape otherwise devoid of surface rivers or lakes. The caves themselves are adorned with dramatic stalactites and stalagmites, and serve as natural outlets for escaping gases. Surrounding these caves, the lowlands have given rise to lakes and sloughs, while the dense forests above offer sanctuary to sea birds and water fowls. The roots of trees, in their desperate search for water, can be seen plunging down the sheer brinks of the senotes, sometimes reaching a hundred feet to touch the hidden waters below, illustrating the profound and intricate relationship between the caves and the living world around them.",
