    "generated_answer": "assistant\n\n\nYes, older age is associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma. This is partly due to cumulative sun damage over a lifetime and a weakened immune system, which may reduce the body's ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells. The risk generally rises with age, making sun protection and regular skin checks more critical for older individuals.",

Genetic factors, such as mutations in genes like TP53 or CDKN2A, may contribute to a predisposition, though most cases are linked to environmental factors like UV exposure. While UV radiation remains the primary cause, inherited genetic syndromes can elevate risk in individuals with a family history.",

    "generated_answer": "assistant\n\n\nImmune suppression is a known risk factor for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) because it impairs the body's ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy, such as those with HIV or post-organ transplant, have an increased risk due to reduced immune surveillance. Additionally, long-term use of immunosuppressants may enhance UV light-induced DNA damage, further promoting BCC development.",
