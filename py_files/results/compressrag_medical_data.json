    "question_type": "Fact Retrieval",
    "generated_answer": "Yes, older age is a known risk factor for basal cell carcinoma. As people age, their skin becomes more susceptible to UV damage, and cellular repair mechanisms slow down, increasing the likelihood of malignant transformations. Additionally, prolonged sun exposure over a lifetime contributes to this risk.",

Individuals with a family history of the disease may have inherited genetic mutations that elevate their risk, making them more likely to develop the condition. This connection underscores the importance of genetic counseling and screening for those with a familial link.",

    "question_type": "Fact Retrieval",
    "generated_answer": "Immune suppression is a risk factor for Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) because it weakens the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate cancerous cells. This compromised immunity increases susceptibility to skin cancers like BCC. Additionally, immune suppression is often linked to conditions that heighten cancer risk.",
