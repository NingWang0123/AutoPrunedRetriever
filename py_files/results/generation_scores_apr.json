The first step is to determine the histological subtype, distinguishing between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which originates from the squamous cells of the upper and middle esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, arising from the mucus-secreting cells typically found in the lower esophagus, often associated with Barrett esophagus. Staging is crucial: early-stage disease remains confined to the esophagus without lymph node involvement, while locoregional disease involves invasion of the esophageal wall and/or spread to regional lymph nodes or adjacent organs. Metastatic disease is defined by distant spread, particularly to the liver, lung, bone, or brain. The diagnostic workup includes blood tests, imaging (such as CT or PET scans), endoscopic evaluation with biopsy for histopathological confirmation, biomarker testing, and assessment of genetic risk factors. For tumors at the esophagogastric junction, Siewert classification assists in accurate staging.

Specifically, I would obtain a lymph node biopsy, followed by immunophenotyping to identify B-cell lineage markers. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are necessary to assess marrow involvement. Imaging (such as CT or PET-CT) would help determine the extent of nodal and extranodal disease. The pathologist would evaluate the lymph node specimen for the proportion of centrocytes and centroblasts, which determines the FL grade (grades 1, 2, 3A, or 3B). This grading is crucial as it guides management: grades 1 and 2 are treated as classic FL, while grade 3B is managed as DLBCL. Furthermore, I would assess for the presence of BCL2 protein overexpression or t(14;18) translocation, which are characteristic of FL.

These tests distinguish CML from other blood disorders and are critical for selecting appropriate therapy. Targeted treatments that inhibit the BCR::ABL1 protein have dramatically improved outcomes. Public health initiatives should ensure access to advanced molecular diagnostics for all suspected CML patients.",

CBCLs develop from abnormal B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell involved in immune defense. The pathogenesis involves unregulated growth of these lymphocytes, resulting in disease. CBCL typically presents as nodules or papules confined to the skin. Diagnosis requires a combination of skin examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and confirmatory biopsy with immunophenotyping to determine cell lineage. Further testing for biomarkers and genetic changes aids in precise classification. Major CBCL subtypes include primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PC-DLBCL, leg type).

I would order a peripheral blood smear to further characterize granulocyte lineage and identify abnormal cells. Next, I would request a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to assess myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and to look for any increase in blasts, which could indicate blast phase CML (BP-CML). Cytogenetic analysis would be performed to detect the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), the abnormal chromosome 22 resulting from the translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Additionally, molecular testing for the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene would be conducted, as its presence is required for a definitive diagnosis of CML.
