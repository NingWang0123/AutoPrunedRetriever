She worked tirelessly from home, orchestrating the complex logistics required to equip and dispatch the units overseas, and navigated the many bureaucratic and diplomatic challenges that arose. Recognizing the dangers her all-women teams would face on the front lines, she accepted and abided by the Foreign Office’s stipulations for their safety, maintaining close cooperation with both the Admiralty and the Foreign Office—particularly with Lord Robert Cecil. These assurances were not easily won, as the idea of women-staffed hospitals serving with active armies was met with skepticism and resistance. Nevertheless, Inglis’s persistence, her willingness to meet official requirements, and her ability to coordinate international support—including American aid—ensured that the hospitals could operate effectively and honorably, even amid the chaos and privations of war."
