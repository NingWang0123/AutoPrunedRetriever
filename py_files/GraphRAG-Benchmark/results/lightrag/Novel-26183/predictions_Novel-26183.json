    "ground_truth": "Schummel’s works, including 'Die Gleichheit der menschlichen Herzen' and 'Der Greis,' were met with pointed criticism in the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek. The reviews, while lengthy and indicative of significant interest, often censured Schummel as a childish imitator, with his book at times dismissed as 'beneath criticism.' The reviewers highlighted his attempts to mimic the style and sentiment of Sterne, noting both direct imitations and eccentricities in his writing. Musäus’s published review in the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek played a notable role in shaping the reception of Schummel’s works, offering both critical analysis and, at moments, reluctant praise, thus influencing contemporary and subsequent perceptions of Schummel’s literary efforts."

    "ground_truth": "Joachim Heinrich Campe offered a nuanced critique of 'Empfindsamkeit' in his publication 'Ueber Empfindsamkeit und Empfindelei in pädagogischer Hinsicht', where he carefully distinguished between genuine moral sensibility and its excessive or superficial forms. He defined 'Empfindsamkeit' as a receptivity to feelings that are rooted in moral joy or pain, emphasizing that, when balanced with reason, it is a valuable and beneficent human capacity. However, he warned that when this sensibility becomes exaggerated and loses harmony with other faculties, it turns destructive, both for the individual and society. To clarify this, Campe reserved 'Empfindsamkeit' for the justly proportioned, sincere expression of feeling, while labeling its irrational, affected, or trivial manifestations as 'Empfindelei'. He further illustrated these distinctions through examples, contrasting authentic, quiet, and serious emotion with theatrical, vain, and shallow displays. This careful differentiation, first articulated in his pedagogical essay, was reiterated and expanded in his later work 'Ueber die Reinigung und Bereicherung der deutschen Sprache', where he continued to warn against the dangers of overwrought sentimentality and the epidemic of superficial feeling."
