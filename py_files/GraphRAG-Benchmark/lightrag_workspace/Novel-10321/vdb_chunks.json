Riley 1885 BOOK THE FIRST. AN EPIGRAM ON THE AMOURS. |We who of late were five books [001] of Naso, are now but three: this work our author has preferred to the former one. Though it should [002] now be no pleasure to thee to read us; still, the labour will be less, the two being removed. ELEGY I. _He says that he is compelled by Cupid to write of love instead of battles and that the Divinity insists on making each second Hexameter line into a Pentameter._ |I was preparing to write of arms and impetuous warfare in serious numbers, [003] the subject-matter being suited to the measure. [004] The second verse was of equal measure with the first; but Cupid is said to have smiled, and to have abstracted one foot. [005] \"Who, cruel boy, has given thee this right over my lines? We poets are the choir of _the Muses,_ the Pierian maids, not thine. What if Venus were to seize the arms of the yellow-haired Minerva, _and_ if the yellow-haired Minerva were to wave the lighted torches _of Love?_ Who would approve of Ceres holding her reign in the woods on the mountain ridges, _or_ of the fields being tilled under the control of the quivered Virgin? Who would arm Phoebus, graceful with his locks, with the sharp spear, while Mars is striking the Aonian lyre? Thy sway, O youth, is great, and far too potent; why, in thy ambition, dost thou attempt a new task? Is that which is everywhere, thine? Is Heliconian Tempe thine? Is even his own lyre hardly safe now for Phoebus? When the new page has made a good beginning in the first line, at that moment does he diminish my energies. [008] I have no subject fitted for _these_ lighter numbers, whether youth, or girl with her flowing locks arranged.\" _Thus_ was I complaining; when, at once, his quiver loosened, [009] he selected the arrows made for my destruction; and he stoutly bent upon his knee the curving bow, and said, \"Poet, receive a subject on which to sing.\" Ah wretched me! unerring arrows did that youth possess. I burn; and in my heart, _hitherto_ disengaged, does Love hold sway. _Henceforth_, in six feet [010] let my work commence; in five let it close. Farewell, ye ruthless wars, together with your numbers. My Muse, [011] to eleven feet destined to be attuned, bind with the myrtle of the sea shore thy temples encircled with their yellow _locks_. ELEGY II. _He says, that being taken captive by Love, he allows Cupid to lead him away in triumph._ |Why shall I say it is, that my bed appears thus hard to me, and that my clothes rest not upon the couch? The night, too, long as it is, have I passed without sleep; and why do the weary bones of my restless body ache? But were I assailed by any flame, I think I should be sensible of it. Or does _Love_ come unawares and cunningly attack in silent ambush? 'Tis so; his little arrows have pierced my heart; and cruel Love is tormenting the breast he has seized. Am I to yield? Or by struggling _against it_, am I to increase this sudden flame? I must yield; the burden becomes light which is borne contentedly. I have seen the flames increase when agitated by waving the torch; and when no one shook it, I have seen them die away. The galled bulls suffer more blows while at first they refuse the yoke, than those whom experience of the plough avails. The horse which is unbroken bruises his mouth with the hard curb; the one that is acquainted with arms is less sensible of the bit. Love goads more sharply and much more cruelly those who struggle, than those who agree to endure his servitude. Lo! I confess it; I am thy new-made prey, O Cupid; I am extending my conquered hands for thy commands. No war _between us_ is needed; I entreat for peace and for pardon; and no credit shall I be to thee, unarmed, conquered by thy arms. Bind thy locks with myrtle; yoke thy mother's doves; thy stepfather [014] himself will give a chariot which becomes thee. And in the chariot _so_ given thee, thou shalt stand, and with thy skill shalt guide the birds _so_ yoked [015], while the people shout \"_Io_ triumphe\" [016] aloud. The captured youths and the captive fair shall be led _in triumph_; this procession shall be a splendid triumph for thee. I myself, a recent capture, shall bear my wound _so_ lately made; and with the feelings of a captive shall I endure thy recent chains. Soundness of Understanding shall-be led along with hands bound behind his back, Shame as well, and whatever _beside_ is an enemy to the camp of Love. All things shall stand in awe of thee: towards thee the throng, stretching forth its hands, shall sing \"Io triumphe\" with loud voice. Caresses shall be thy attendants, Error too, and Madness, a troop that ever follows on thy side. With these for thy soldiers, thou dost overcome", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e937ae9f431c4368aa293a51bc61c19e", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "recent chains.

Caresses shall be thy attendants, Error too, and Madness, a troop that ever follows on thy side. With these for thy soldiers, thou dost overcome both men and Gods; take away from thee these advantages, _and_ thou wilt be helpless. From highest Olympus thy joyous mother will applaud thee in thy triumph, and will sprinkle her roses falling on thy face. While gems bedeck thy wings, _and_ gems thy hair; in thy golden chariot shalt thou go, resplendent thyself with gold. [017] Then too, (if well I know thee) wilt thou influence not a few; then too, as thou passest by, wilt thou inflict many a wound. Thy arrows (even shouldst thou thyself desire it) cannot be at rest. A glowing flame _ever_ injures by the propinquity of its heat. Just such was Bacchus when the Gangetic land [018] was subdued; thou art the burden of the birds; he was _that_ of the tigers. Therefore, since I may be some portion of thy hallowed triumph, forbear, Conqueror, to expend thy strength on me. Look at the prospering arms of thy kinsman Cæsar; [019] with the same hand with which he conquers does he shield the conquered. [020] ELEGY III. _He entreats his mistress to return his affection, and shows that he is deserving of her favour._ |I ask for what is just; let the fair who has so lately captivated me, either love me, or let her give me a cause why I should always love her. Alas! too much have I desired; only let her allow herself to be loved; _and then_ Cytherea will have listened to my prayers so numerous. Accept one who will be your servant through lengthened years; accept one who knows how to love with constant attachment. If the great names of ancient ancestors do not recommend me, or if the Equestrian founder of my family [021] _fails to do so_; and _if_ no field of mine is renewed by ploughs innumerable, and each of my parents [022] with frugal spirit limits my expenditure; still Phoebus and his nine companions and the discoverer of the vine may do so; and Love _besides_, who presents me as a gift to you; a fidelity, too that will yield to none, manners above reproach, ingenuousness without guile, and modesty _ever_ able to blush. A thousand damsels have no charms for me; I am no rover in affection; [023] you will for ever be my choice, if you do but believe me. May it prove my lot to live with you for years as many as the threads of the Sister _Destinies_ shall grant me, and to die with you sorrowing _for me_. Grant me yourself as a delightful theme for my verse; worthy of their matter my lines will flow. Io, frightened by her horns, and she whom the adulterer deceived in _the shape of_ the bird [024] of the stream have a name in song; she, too, who, borne over the seas upon the fictitious bull, held fast the bending horns with her virgin hand. We, too, together shall be celebrated throughout all the world; and my name shall ever be united with thy own. ELEGY IV. _He instructs his mistress what conduct to-observe in the presence of her husband at a feast to which he has been invited._ _Your_ husband is about to come to the same banquet [026] as ourselves: I pray that it may be the last meal [027] for this husband of yours. And am I then only as a guest to look upon the fair so much beloved? And shall there be another, to take pleasure in being touched _by you?_ And will you, conveniently placed below, be keeping warm the bosom of another? [028] _And_ shall he, when he pleases, be placing his hand upon your neck? Cease to be surprised that the beauteous damsel of Atrax [029] excited the two-formed men to combat when the wine was placed _on table_. No wood is my home, and my limbs adhere not to _those of_ a horse; _yet_ I seem to be hardly able to withhold my hands from you. Learn, however, what must be done by you; and do not give my injunctions to be borne away by the Eastern gales, nor on the warm winds of the South. Come before your husband; and yet, I do not see what can be done, if you do come first; but still, do come first. [031] When he presses the couch, with modest air you will be going as his companion, to recline by him; _then_ secretly touch my foot. [032] Keep your eye on me, and my nods and the expression of my features; apprehend my secret signs, [033] and yourself return them. Without utterance will I give expression to words by my eyebrows; [034] you shall read words traced by my fingers, words _traced_ in the wine. [035] When the delights of our dalliance recur to your thoughts, press your blooming cheeks [036] with your beauteous finger.

[035] When the delights of our dalliance recur to your thoughts, press your blooming cheeks [036] with your beauteous finger. If there shall be anything, of which you may be making complaint about me silently in your mind, let your delicate hand reach from the extremity of your ear. When, my life, I shall either do or say aught which shall give you delight, let your ring be continually twisted on your fingers. [037] Take hold of the table with your hand, in the way in which those who are in prayer [038] take hold _of the altar_, when you shall be wishing many an evil for your husband, who so well deserves it. _The cup_ which he has mixed for you, if you are discreet, [039] bid him drink himself; _then_, in a low voice, do you ask the servant [041] for what _wine_ you wish. I will at once take the cup which you have put down; [042] and where you have sipped, on that side will I drink. If, perchance, he shall give you any morsels, of which he has tasted beforehand, reject them _thus_ touched by his mouth. [043] And do not allow him to press your neck, by putting his arms around it; nor recline your gentle head on his unsightly breast. [044] Let not your bosom, or your breasts so close at hand, [045] admit his fingers; _and_ especially allow him to give you no kisses. If you do give him _any_ kisses, I shall be discovered to be your lover, and I shall say, \"Those are my own,\" and shall be laying hands upon him. Still, this I shall _be able to_ see; but what the clothing carefully conceals, the same will be a cause for me of apprehension full of doubts. Touch not his thigh with yours, and cross not legs with him, and do not unite your delicate foot with his uncouth leg. To my misery, I am apprehensive of many a thing, because many a thing have I done in my wantonness; and I myself am tormented, through fear of my own precedent. Oft _by joining hands_ beneath the cloth, [048] have my mistress and I forestalled our hurried delights. This, I _am sure_, you will not do _for him_; but that you may not _even_ be supposed to do so, take away the conscious covering [049] from your bosom. Bid your husband drink incessantly, but let there be no kisses with your entreaties; and while he is drinking, if you can, add wine by stealth. [050] If he shall be soundly laid asleep with dozing and wine, circumstances and opportunity will give us _fitting_ counsel. When you shall rise to go home, we all will rise as well; _and_ remember that you walk in the middle rank of the throng. In that rank you will either find me, or be found _by me_; _and_ whatever part of me you can there touch, _mind and_ touch. Ah wretched me! I have given advice to be good for _but_ a few hours; _then_, at the bidding of night, I am separated from my mistress. At night her husband will lock her in; I, sad with my gushing tears, will follow her as far as I may, even to her obdurate door. _And_ now will he be snatching a kiss; _and_ now not kisses only will he snatch; you will be compelled to grant him that, which by stealth you grant to me. But grant him this (you can do so) with a bad grace, and like one acting by compulsion; let no caresses be heard; and let Venus prove inauspicious. If my wishes avail, I trust, too, that he will find no satisfaction therein; but if otherwise, still at least let it have no delights for you. But, however, whatever luck may attend upon the night, assure me in positive language to-morrow, that you did not dally with him. ELEGY V. _The beauties of Corinna._ |Twas summer time, [051] and the day had passed the hour of noon; _when_ I threw my limbs to be refreshed on the middle of the couch. A part of the window [053] was thrown open, the other part shut; the light was such as the woods are wont to have; just as the twilight glimmers, when Phoebus is retreating; or _as_ when the night has gone, and still the day is not risen. Such light should be given to the bashful fair, in which coy modesty may hope to have concealment. Behold! Corinna [054] came, clothed in a tunic [055] hanging loose, her flowing hair [056] covering her white neck.

I drew aside the tunic; in its thinness [059] it was but a small impediment; still, to be covered with the tunic did she strive; and, as she struggled as though she was not desirous to conquer, without difficulty was she overcome, through betrayal of herself. When, her clothing laid aside, she stood before my eyes, throughout her whole body nowhere was there a blemish. What shoulders, what arms I _both_ saw and touched! The contour of her breast, how formed was it to be pressed! How smooth her stomach beneath her faultless bosom! How full and how beauteous her sides! How plump with youthfulness the thigh! _But_ why enlarge on every point? Nothing did I behold not worthy of praise; and I pressed her person even to my own. The rest, who knows not? Wearied, we both reclined. May such a midday often prove my lot. ELEGY VI. _He entreats the porter to open to him the door of his mistress's house._ Porter, fastened (_and_ how unworthily!) with the cruel fetter, [060] throw open the stubborn door with its turning hinge. What I ask, is but a trifle; let the door, half-opened, admit me sideways with its narrow passage. Protracted Love has made my body thin for such an emergency, and by diminishing my bulk, has rendered my limbs _quite_ supple.'Tis he who shows me how to go softly amid the watches of the keepers; [062] 'tis he directs my feet that meet no harm. But, at one time, I used to be afraid of the night and imaginary ghosts; _and_ I used to be surprised if any one was about to go in the dark: Cupid, with his graceful mother, laughed, so that I could hear him, and he softly said, \"Thou too wilt become bold.\" Without delay, love came _upon me_; then, I feared not spectres that flit by night, [063] or hands uplifted for my destruction. I only fear you, _thus_ too tardy; you alone do I court; you hold the lightning by which you can effect my destruction. Look (and that you may see, loosen the obdurate bars) how the door has been made wet with my tears. At all events, 'twas I, who, when, your garment laid aside, you stood ready for the whip, [064] spoke in your behalf to your mistress as you were trembling. Does then, (O shocking thought!) the credit which once prevailed in your behalf, now fail to prevail in my own favour? Give a return for my kindness; you may _now_ be grateful. As you wish, [065] the hours of the night pass on; [066] from the door-post [067] strike away the bar. Strike it away then may you one day be liberated from your long fetters and may the water of the slave [068] be not for ever drunk of by you. Hard-hearted porter! you hear me, as I implore in vain; the door, supported by its hard oaken _posts_, is still unmoved. Let the protection of a closed gate be of value to cities when besieged; _but_ why, in the midst of peace are you dreading warfare? What would you do to an enemy, who thus shut out the lover? The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. I am not come attended with soldiers and with arms; I should be alone, if ruthless Love were not here. Him, even if I should desire it, I can never send away; first should I be even severed from my limbs. Love then, and a little wine about my temples, [069] are with me, and the chaplet falling from off my anointed hair. Who is to dread arms _such_ as these? Who may not go out to face them? The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. Are you delaying? or does sleep (who but ill befriends the lover) give to the winds my words, as they are repelled from your ear? But, I remember, when formerly I used to avoid you, you were awake, with the stars of the midnight. Perhaps, too, your own mistress is now asleep with you; alas! how much superior _then_ is your fate to my own! And since 'tis so, pass on to me, ye cruel chains. The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. Am I mistaken? Or did the door-posts creak with the turning hinge, and did the shaken door give the jarring signal? Yes, I am mistaken; the door was shaken by the boisterous wind. Ah me! how far away has that gust borne my hopes! Boreas, if well thou dost keep in mind the ravished Orithyia, come hither, and with thy blast beat open this relentless door. 'Tis silence throughout all the City; damp with the glassy dew, the hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. Otherwise I, myself, [073] now better prepared _than you_, with my sword, and with the fire which I am holding in my torch, [074] will scale this arrogant abode. Night, and lore, and wine, [075] are persuasive of no moderation; the first is without shame, Bacchus and Love _are without fear_. I have expended every method; neither by entreaties nor by threats have I moved you, O _man,", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-59e1a5f4174321002296136e39cacfb9", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "the bar.

It becomes you not to watch the threshold of the beauteous fair; of the anxieties of the prison, [076] are you more deserving. And now Lucifer is moving his wheels beset with rime; and the bird is arousing [077] wretched _mortals_ to their work. But, chaplet taken from my locks joyous no longer, be you the livelong night upon this obdurate threshold. You, when in the morning she shall see you _thus_ exposed, will be a witness of my time thus thrown away. _Porter_, whatever your disposition, good bye, and _one day_ experience the pangs of him who is now departing; sluggish one, and worthless in not admitting the lover, fare you well. And you, ye cruel door-posts, with your stubborn threshold; and _you, ye_ doors, equally slaves, [078] hard-hearted blocks of wood, farewell. ELEGY VII. _He has beaten his mistress, and endeavours to regain her favour._ |Put my hands in manacles (they are deserving of chains), if any friend of mine is present, until all my frenzy has departed. For frenzy has raised my rash arms against my mistress; hurt by my frantic hand, the fair is weeping. In such case could I have done an injury even to my dear parents, or have given unmerciful blows to even the hallowed Gods. Why; did not Ajax, too, [080] the owner of the sevenfold shield, slaughter the flocks that he had caught along the extended plains? And did Orestes, the guilty avenger of his father, the punisher of his mother, dare to ask for weapons against the mystic Goddesses? [081] And could I then tear her tresses so well arranged; and were not her displaced locks unbecoming to my mistress? Even thus was she beauteous; in such guise they say that the daughter of Schoeneus [082] pursued the wild beasts of Mænalus with her bow. 'Twere more fitting for her face to be pale from the impress of kisses, and for her neck to bear the marks of the toying teeth. In such guise did the Cretan damsel [083] weep, that the South winds, in their headlong flight, had borne away both the promises and the sails of the forsworn Theseus. Thus, _too_, chaste Minerva, did Cassandra [084] fall in thy temple, except that her locks were bound with the fillet. Who did not say to me, \"You madman!\" who did not say _to me_, \"You barbarian!\" She herself _said_ not a word; her tongue was restrained by timid apprehensions. But still her silent features pronounced my censure; by her tears _and_ by her silent lips did she convict me. First could I wish that my arms had fallen from off my shoulders; to better purpose could I have parted with a portion of myself. To my own disadvantage had I the strength of a madman; and for my own punishment did I stoutly exert my strength. What do I want with you, ye ministers of death and criminality? Impious hands, submit to the chains, your due. Should I not have been punished had I struck the humblest Roman [085] of the multitude? _And_ shall I have a greater privilege against my mistress? The son of Tydeus has left the worst instance of crime: he was the first to strike a Goddess, [086] I, the second. But less guilty was he; by me, she, whom I asserted to be loved _by me_, was injured; against an enemy the son of Tydeus was infuriate. Come now, conqueror, prepare your boastful triumphs; bind your locks with laurel, and pay your vows to Jove, and let the multitude, the train, that escorts your chariot, shout aloud, \"Io _triumphe!_ by _this_ valiant man has the fair been conquered!\" Let the captive, in her sadness, go before with dishevelled locks, pale all over, if her hurt cheeks [087] may allow. In short, if, after the manner of a swelling torrent, I was impelled, and if impetuous anger did make me its prey; would it not have been enough to have shouted aloud at the trembling girl, and not to have thundered out my threats far too severe? Or else, to my own disgrace, to have torn her tunic from its upper edge down to the middle? Her girdle should, at the middle [089] have come to its aid. But now, in the hardness of my heart, I could dare, seizing her hair on her forehead, to mark her free-born cheeks [090] with my nails. _There_ she stood, amazed, with her features pale and bloodless, just as the marble is cut in the Parian mountains.

Her tears, too, so long repressed, flowed down her face, just as the water flows from the snow when heaped up. Then, for the first time, did I begin to be sensible that I was guilty; the tears which she was shedding were _as_ my own blood. Yet, thrice was I ready, suppliantly to throw myself before her feet; thrice did she repel my dreaded hands. But, _dearest,_ do not you hesitate, (_for_ revenge will lessen your grief) at once to attack my face with your nails. Spare not my eyes, nor _yet_ my hair; let anger nerve your hands, weak though they may be. And that tokens so shocking of my criminality may no longer exist, put your locks, arranged anew, in their proper order. [092] ELEGY VIII. _He curses a certain procuress, whom he overhears instructing his mistress in the arts of a courtesan._ |There is a certain--(whoever wishes to make acquaintance with a procuress, let him listen.)--There is a certain old hag, Dipsas by name. From fact does she derive [094] her name; never in a sober state does she behold the mother of the swarthy Memnon with her horses of roseate hue. She knows well the magic arts, and the charms of Ææa, [095] and by her skill she turns back to its source [096] the flowing stream. She knows right well what the herbs, what the thrums impelled around the whirling spinning-wheel, [097] _and_ what the venomous exudation [098] from the prurient mare can effect. When she wills it, the clouds are overspread throughout all the sky; when she wills it, the day is bright with a clear atmosphere. I have beheld (if I may be believed) the stars dripping with blood: the face of the moon was empurpled [099] with gore. I believe that she, transformed, [101] was flying amid the shades of night, and that her hag's carcase was covered with feathers. _This_ I believe, and such is the report. A double pupil, too, [102] sparkles in her eyes, and light proceeds from a twofold eyeball. Forth from the ancient sepulchres she calls our great grandsires, and their grandsires [103] as well; and with her long incantations she cleaves the solid ground. She has made it her occupation to violate the chaste bed; and besides, her tongue is not \"wanting in guilty advocacy. Chance made me the witness of her language; in such words was she giving her advice; the twofold doors [105] concealed me. \"You understand, my life, how greatly you yesterday pleased a wealthy young man; _for_ he stopped short, and stood gazing for some time on your face. And whom do you not please? Your beauty is inferior to no one's. _But_ woe is me! your person has not a fitting dress. I _only_ wish you were as well off, as you are distinguished for beauty; if you became rich, I should not be poor. The adverse star of Mars in opposition [106] was unfortunate for you; Mars has gone; now Venus is befriending you with her planet. See now how favourable she is on her approach; a rich lover is sighing for you, and he makes it his care [107] what are your requirements. He has good looks, too, that may compare with your own; if he did not wish to have you at a price, he were worthy himself to be purchased.\" _On this the damsel_ blushed: [108] \"Blushing,\" _said the hag_, \"suits a faircomplexion indeed; but if you _only_ pretend it, 'tis an advantage; _if_ real, it is wont to be injurious. When, your eyes cast down, [109] you are looking full upon your bosom, each man must _only_ be looked at in the proportion in which he offers. Possibly the sluttish Sabine females, [111] when Tati us was king, were unwilling to be accommodating to more men _than one_. Now-a-days, Mars employs the bravery _of our men_ in foreign warfare; [112] but Venus holds sway in the City of her own Æneas. Enjoy yourselves, my pretty ones; she is chaste, whom nobody has courted; or else, if coyness does not prevent her, she herself is the wooer. Dispel these frowns [113] as well, which you are carrying upon your lofty brow; with those frowns will numerous failings be removed. Penelope used to try [114] the strength of the young men upon the bow; the bow that tested _the strength_ of their sides, was made of horn. Age glides stealthily on, and beguiles us as it flies; just as the swift river glides onward with its flowing waters. Brass grows bright by use; good clothes require to be worn; uninhabited buildings grow white with nasty mould.

Penelope used to try [114] the strength of the young men upon the bow; the bow that tested _the strength_ of their sides, was made of horn. Age glides stealthily on, and beguiles us as it flies; just as the swift river glides onward with its flowing waters. Brass grows bright by use; good clothes require to be worn; uninhabited buildings grow white with nasty mould. Unless you entertain _lovers_, beauty _soon_ waxes old, with no one to enjoy it; and _even_ one or two _lovers_ are not sufficiently profitable. From many _of them_, gain is more sure, and not so difficult to be got. An abundant prey falls to the hoary wolves out of a _whole_ flock. \"See now! what does this poet of yours make you a present of besides his last verses? You will read many thousands of them by _this_ new lover. The God himself of poets, graceful in his mantle [116] adorned with gold, strikes the harmonious strings of the gilded lyre. He that shall make you presents, let him be to you greater than great Homer; believe me, it is a noble thing to give. And, if there shall be any one redeemed at a price for his person [117], do not you despise him; the fault of having the foot rubbed with chalk [118] is a mere trifle. Neither let the old-fashioned wax busts about the halls [119] take you in; pack off with your forefathers, you needy lover. Nay more, should [120] one, because he is good-looking, ask for a night without a present; _why_, let him first solicit his own admirer for something to present to you. \"Be less exacting of presents, while you are laying your nets, _for fear_ lest they should escape you: _once_ caught, tease them at your own pleasure. Pretended affection, too, is not a bad thing; let him fancy he is loved; but have you a care that this affection is not all for nothing. Often refuse your favours; sometimes pretend a head-ache; and sometimes there will be Isis [121] to afford a pretext. _But_ soon admit him again; that he may acquire no habits of endurance, and that his love, so often repulsed, may not begin to flag. Let your door be deaf to him who entreats, open to him who brings. Let the lover that is admitted, hear the remarks of him who is excluded. And, as though you were the first injured, sometimes get in a passion with him when injured _by you_. His censure, when counterbalanced by your censure, [127] may wear away. But do you never afford a long duration for anger; prolonged anger frequently produces hatred. Moreover, let your eyes learn, at discretion, to shed tears; and let this cause or that cause your cheeks to be wet. And do not, if you deceive any one, hesitate to be guilty of perjury; Venus lends _but_ a deaf hearing [128] to deceived _lovers_. \"Let a male servant and a crafty handmaid [129] be trained up to their parts; who may instruct him what may be conveniently purchased for you. And let them ask but little for themselves; if they ask a little of many, [130] very soon, great will be the heap from the gleanings. [131] Let your sister, and your mother, and your nurse as well, fleece your admirer. A booty is soon made, that is sought by many hands. When occasions for asking for presents shall fail you, call attention with a cake [132] to your birthday Take care that no one loves you in security, without a rival; love is not very lasting if you remove _all_ rivalry. Let him perceive the traces of _another_ person on the couch; all your neck, too, discoloured by the marks of toying. Especially let him see the presents, which another has sent. If he gives you nothing, the Sacred Street [133] must be talked about. When you have received many things, but yet he has not given you every thing, be continually asking him to lend you something, for you never to return. Let your tongue aid you, and let it conceal your thoughts; [134] caress him, and prove his ruin. [135] Beneath the luscious honey cursed poisons lie concealed. If you observe these precepts, tried by me throughout a long experience; and if the winds and the breezes do not bear away my words; often will you bless me while I live; often will you pray, when I am dead, that in quietude my bones may repose.\". She was in the middle of her speech, when my shadow betrayed me; but my hands with difficulty refrained from tearing her grey scanty locks, and her eyes bleared with wine, and her wrinkled cheeks. May the Gods grant you both no home, [136] and a needy old age; prolonged winters as well, and everlasting thirst. ELEGY IX. _He tells Atticus that like the soldier, the lover ought to be on his guard and that Love is a species of warfare._ |Every lover is a soldier, and Cupid has a camp of his own; believe me, Atticus, [138] every lover is a soldier.

The age which is fitted for war, is suited to love as well. For an old man to be a soldier, is shocking; amorousness in an old man is shocking. The years which [139] generals require in the valiant soldier, the same does the charming fair require in her husband. Both _soldier and lover_ pass sleepless nights; both rest upon the ground. The one watches at the door of his mistress; but the other _at that_ of his general. [140] Long marches are the duty of the soldier; send the fair _far_ away, _and_ the lover will boldly follow her, without a limit _to his endurance_. Over opposing mountains will he go, and rivers swollen with rains; the accumulating snows will he pace. About to plough the waves, he will not reproach the stormy East winds; nor will he watch for Constellations favourable for scudding over the waves. Who, except either the soldier or the lover, will submit to both the chill of the night, and the snows mingled with the heavy showers? The one is sent as a spy against the hostile foe; the other keeps his eye on his rival, as though upon an enemy. The one lays siege to stubborn cities, the other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress: the one bursts open gates, and the other, doors. [142] Full oft has it answered to attack the enemy when buried in sleep; and to slaughter an unarmed multitude with armed hand. Thus did the fierce troops of the Thracian Rhesus [143] fall; and you, captured steeds, forsook your lord. Full oft do lovers take advantage of the sleep of husbands, and brandish their arms against the slumbering foe. To escape the troops of the sentinels, and the bands of the patrol, is the part _both_ of the soldier, and of the lover always in misery. Mars is wayward, and Venus is uncertain; both the conquered rise again, and those fall whom you would say could never possibly be prostrate. Whoever, then, has pronounced Love _mere_ slothfulness, let him cease _to love_: [144] to the discerning mind does Love belong. The mighty Achilles is inflamed by the captive Briseis. Trojans, while you may, destroy the Argive resources. Hector used to go to battle _fresh_ from the embraces of Andromache; and it was his wife who placed his helmet on his head. The son of Atreus, the first of _all_ the chiefs, on beholding the daughter of Priam, is said to have been smitten with the dishevelled locks of the raving _prophetess_. [146] Mars, too, when caught, was sensible of the chains wrought at the forge; [147] there was no story better known than his, in all the heavens. I myself was of slothful habit, and born for a lazy inactivity; [148] the couch and the shade [149] had enervated my mind. Attentions to the charming fair gave a fillip to me, in my indolence; and _Love_ commanded me to serve [150] in his camp. Hence it is that thou seest me active, and waging the warfare by night. Let him who wishes not to become slothful, fall in love. ELEGY X. _He tells his mistress that she ought not to require presents as a return for her love._ |Such as she, who, borne away from the Eurotas, [151] in the Phrygian ships, was the cause of warfare to her two husbands; such as Leda was, whom her crafty paramour, concealed in his white feathers, deceived under _the form of_ a fictitious bird; such as Amymone [152] used to wander in the parched _fields of_ Argos, when the urn was pressing the locks on the top of her head; such were you; and I was in dread of both the eagle and the bull with respect to you, and whatever _form besides_ Love has created of the mighty Jove. Now, all fears are gone, and the disease of my mind is cured; and now no longer does that form _of yours_ rivet my eyes. Do you inquire why I am changed? _It is_, because you require presents. This reason does not allow of your pleasing me. So long as you were disinterested, I was in love with your mind together with your person; now, _in my estimation_ your appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition. Love is both a child and naked; he has years without sordidness, and _he wears_ no clothes, that he may be without concealment. Why do you require the son of Venus to be prostituted at a price? He has no fold in his dress, [153] in which to conceal that price. Neither Venus is suited for cruel arms, nor yet the son of Venus; it befits not such unwarlike Divinities to serve for pay. The courtesan stands for hire to any one at a certain price; and with her submissive body, she seeks for wretched pelf. Still, she curses the tyranny of the avaricious procurer; [154] and she does by compulsion [155] what you are doing of your own free will. Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking thing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes.

Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking thing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes. The mare asks no gift of the horse, nor the cow of the bull; the ram does not woo the ewe, induced by presents. Woman alone takes pleasure in spoils torn from the man; she alone lets out her nights; alone is she on sale, to be hired at a price. She sells, too, _joys_ that delight them both, _and_ which both covet; and she makes it a _matter_ of pay, at what price she herself is to be gratified. Those joys, which are so equally sweet to both, why does the one sell, and _why_ the other buy them? Why must that delight prove a loss to me, to you a gain, for which the female and the male combine with kindred impulse? Witnesses hired dishonestly, [156] sell their perjuries; the chest [157] of the commissioned judge [158] is disgracefully open _for the bribe_. 'Tis a dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with a tongue that is purchased; [159] 'tis a disgrace for a tribunal to make great acquisitions. 'Tis a disgrace for a woman to increase her patrimonial possessions by the profits of her embraces, and to prostitute her beauty for lucre. Thanks are _justly_ due for things obtained without purchase; there are no thanks for an intercourse disgracefully bartered. He who hires, [160] pays all _his due_; the price _once_ paid, he no longer remains a debtor for your acquiescence. Cease, ye beauties, to bargain for pay for your favours. Sordid gains bring no good results. It was not worth her while to bargain for the Sabine bracelets, [161] in order that the arms should crush the head of the sacred maiden. The son pierced [163] with the sword those entrails from which he had sprung, and a simple necklace [164] was the cause of the punishment. But yet it is not unbecoming for a present to be asked of the wealthy man; he has something to give to her who does ask for a present. Pluck the grapes that hang from the loaded vines; let the fruitful soil of Alcinous [165] afford the apples. Let the needy man proffer duty, zeal, and fidelity; what each one possesses, let him bestow it all upon his mistress. My endowments, too, are in my lines to shig the praises of those fair who deserve them; she, whom I choose, becomes celebrated through my skill. Vestments will rend, gems and gold will spoil; the fame which poesy confers is everlasting. _Still_ I do not detest giving and revolt at it, but at being asked for a price. Cease to demand it, _and_ I will give you that which I refuse you while you ask. ELEGY XI. _He begs Nape to deliver his letter to her mistress, and commences by praising her neatness and dexterity, and the interest she has hitherto manifested in his behalf._ |Nape, skilled at binding the straggling locks [166] and arranging them in order, and not deserving to be reckoned [167] among the female slaves; _known_, too, _by experience_ to be successful in the contrivances of the stealthy night, and clever in giving the signals; [168] you who have so oft entreated Corinna, when hesitating, to come to me; who have been found so often faithful by me in my difficulties; take and carry these tablets, [169] so well-filled, [170] this morning to your mistress; and by your diligence dispel _all_ impeding delay. Neither veins of flint, nor hard iron is in your breast, nor have you a simplicity greater than that of your _clever_ class. There is no doubt that you, too, have experienced the bow of Cupid; in my behalf defend the banner of your service. If _Corinna_ asks what I am doing, you will say that I am living in expectation of the night. The wax inscribed with my persuasive hand is carrying the rest. While I am speaking, time is flying; opportunely give her my tablets, when she is at leisure; but still, make her read them at once. I bid you watch her eyes and her forehead as she reads; from the silent features we may know the future. And _be there_ no delay; when she has read them through, request her to write a long answer; [172] I hate it, when the bleached wax is empty, with a margin on every side. Let her write the lines close as they run, and let the letters traced in the extreme margin long detain my eyes. _But_ what need is there for wearying her fingers with holding the pen?

Her unlucky letter announces that she cannot _be seen_ to-day. There is something in omens; just now, when she was preparing to go, Napè stopped short, having struck her foot [178] against the threshold. When sent out of doors another time, remember to pass the threshold more carefully, and _like_ a sober woman lift your foot high _enough._ Away with you; obdurate tablets, fatal bits of board; and you wax, as well, crammed with the lines of denial. I doubt the Corsican bee [180] has sent you collected from the blossom of the tall hemlock, beneath its abominable honey. Besides, you were red, as though you had been thoroughly dyed in vermilion; [181] such a colour is exactly that of blood. Useless bits of board, thrown out in the street, _there_ may you lie; and may the weight of the wheel crush you, as it passes along. I could even prove that he who formed you to shape from the tree, had not the hands of innocence. That tree surely has afforded a gibbet for some wretched neck, _and_ has supplied the dreadful crosses [182] for the executioner. It has given a disgusting shelter to the screeching owls; in its branches it has borne the eggs of the vulture and of the screech-owl. [183] In my madness, have I entrusted my courtship to these, and have I given soft words to be _thus_ carried to my mistress? These tablets would more becomingly hold the prosy summons, [184] which some judge [185] pronounces, with his sour face. ELEGY XIII. _He entreats the morning not to hasten on with its usual speed._ |Now over the Ocean does she come from her aged husband _Tithonus_, who, with her yellow locks, brings on the day with her frosty chariot. Whither, Aurora, art thou hastening? Stay; _and_ then may the yearly bird, with its wonted death, honour the shades [189] of thy Memnon, its parent. Now do I delight to recline in the soft arms of my mistress; now, if ever, is she deliciously united to my side. Now, too, slumbers are sound, and now the moisture is cooling the birds, too, are sweetly waronng with their little throats. Whither art thou hastening, hated by the men, detested by the fair? Check thy dewy reins with thy rosy hand. [190] Before thy rising, the sailor better observes his Constellations; and he wanders not in ignorance, in the midst of the waves. On thy approach, the wayfarer arises, weary though he be; the soldier lays upon his arms the hands used to bear them. Thou art the first to look upon the tillers of the fields laden with the two-pronged fork; thou art the first to summon the lagging oxen to the crooked yoke. 'Tis thou who dost deprive boys of their sleep, and dost hand them over to their masters; [192], that their tender hands may suffer the cruel stripes. [193] 'Tis thou, too, who dost send the man before the vestibule of the attorney, [194] when about to become bail; [195] that he may submit to the great risks of a single word. Thou art no source of pleasure to the pleader, [198] nor yet to the counsel; for fresh combats each is forced to rise. Thou, when the labours of the females might have had a pause, dost recal the hand of the worker in wool to its task. All _this_ I could endure; but who could allow the fair to arise _thus_ early, except _the man_ who has no mistress of his own? How often have I wished that night would not make way for thee; and that the stars when put to flight would not fly from thy countenance. Many a time have I wished that either the wind would break thy chariot to pieces, or that thy steed would fall, overtaken by _some_ dense cloud. Remorseless one, whither dost thou hasten? Inasmuch as thy son was black, such was the colour of his mother's heart. What if [199] she had not once burned with passion for Cephalus? Or does she fancy that her escapade was not known? I _only_ wish it was allowed Tithonus to tell of thee; there would not be a more coarse tale in _all_ the heavens. While thou art avoiding him, because he is chilled by length of years, thou dost rise early in the morning from _the bed of_ the old man to thy odious chariot. But if thou wast _only_ holding some Cephalus embraced in thy arms; _then_ wouldst thou be crying out, \"Run slowly on, ye horses of the night.\" Why should I be punished in my affections, if thy husband does decay through _length of_ years? Wast thou married to the old fellow by my contrivance?

Wast thou married to the old fellow by my contrivance? See how many hours of sleep the Moon gave [201] to the youth beloved by _her_; and yet her beauty is not inferior to thine. The parent of the Gods himself, that he might not see thee so often, joined two nights together [202] for _the attainment of_ his desires. I had finished my reproaches; you might be sure she heard them; _for_ she blushed'. However, no later than usual did the day arise. ELEGY XIV. _His mistress having been in the habit of dyeing her hair with noxious compositions, she has nearly lost it, becoming almost bald. He reminds her of his former advice, and entreats her to abstain from the practice, on which there may be a chance of her recovering it._ |I always used to say; \"Do leave off doctoring your hair.\" [203] _And_ now you have no hair _left_, that you can be dyeing. But, if you had let it alone, what was more plenteous than it? It used to reach down your sides, so far as ever [204] they extend. And besides: Was it not so fine, that you were afraid to dress [205] it; just like the veils [206] which the swarthy Seres use? Or _like_ the thread which the spider draws out with her slender legs, when she fastens her light work beneath the neglected beam? And yet its colour was not black, nor yet was it golden, but though it was neither, it was a mixture of them both. A _colour_, such as the tall cedar has in the moist vallies of craggy Ida, when its bark is stript off. Besides, it was _quite_ tractable, and falling into a thousand ringlets; and it was the cause of no trouble to you. Neither the bodkin, [208] nor the tooth of the comb _ever_ tore it; your tire woman always had a whole skin. Many a time was it dressed before my eyes; and _yet_, never did the bodkin [210] seized make wounds in her arms. Many a time too, in the morning, her locks not yet arranged, was she lying on the purple couch, with her face half upturned. Then even, unadorned, was she beauteous; as when the Thracian Bacchanal, in her weariness, throws herself carelessly upon the green grass. Still, fine as it was, and just like down, what evils, alas! did her tortured hair endure! How patiently did it submit itself to the iron and the fire; [211] that the curls might become crisp with their twisting circlets. \"'Tis a shame,\" I used to cry, \"'tis a shame, to be burning that hair; naturally it is becoming; do, cruel one, be merciful to your own head. Away with all violence from it; it is not _hair_ that deserves to be scorched; the very locks instruct [212] the bodkins when applied.\" Those beauteous locks are gone; which Apollo might have longed for, _and_ which Bacchus might have wished to be on his own head. With them I might compare those, which naked Dione is painted [213] as once having held up with her dripping hand. Why are you complaining that hair so badly treated is gone? Why, silly girl, do you lay down the mirror [214] with disconsolate hand? You are not seen to advantage by yourself with eyes accustomed _to your former self._ For you to please, you ought to be forgetful of your _former_ self. No enchanted herbs of a rival [215] have done you this injury; no treacherous hag has been washing you with Itæmonian water. The effects, too, of no disease have injured you; (far away be all _bad_ omens; [216]) nor has an envious tongue thinned your abundant locks;'twas your own self who gave the prepared poison to your head. Now Germany will be sending [217] for you her captured locks; by the favour of a conquered race you will be adorned. Ah! how many a time will you have to blush, as any one admires your hair; and _then_ you will say, \"Now I am receiving praise for a bought commodity! In place of myself, he is now bepraising some Sygambrian girl [218] unknown to me; still, I remember _the time_ when that glory was my own.\" Wretch that I am! with difficulty does she restrain her tears; and she covers her face with her hand, having her delicate cheeks suffused with blushes.

ELEGY XV. _He tells the envious that the fame of Poets is immortal, and that theirs is not a life devoted to idleness._ |Why, gnawing Envy, dost thou blame me for years of slothfulness; and _why_ dost thou call poesy the employment of an idle mind? _Thou sayest_ that I do not, after the manner of my ancestors, while vigorous years allow me, seek the prizes of warfare covered with dust; that I do not make myself acquainted with the prosy law, and that I have not let my tongue for hire [221] in the disagreeable courts of justice. The pursuits of which thou art speaking, are perishable; by me, everlasting fame is sought; that to all time I may be celebrated throughout the whole world. The Mæonian bard [222] will live, so long as Tenedos and Ida [223] shall stand; so long as Simois shall roll down to the sea his rapid waves. The Ascræan, too, [224] will live, so long as the grape shall swell with its juices; [225] so long as the corn shall fall, reaped by the curving sickle. The son of Battus [226] will to all time be sung throughout the whole world; although he is not powerful in genius, in his skill he shows his might. No mischance will _ever_ come to the _tragic_ buskin [227] of Sophocles; with the Sun and Moon Aratus [228] will ever exist. So long as the deceitful slave, [229] the harsh father, the roguish procuress, and the cozening courtesan shall endure, Menander will exist. Ennius, [230] without any _art_, and Accius, [231] with his spirited language, have a name that will perish with no lapse of time. What age is to be forgetful of Varro, [232] and the first ship _that sailed_, and of the golden fleece sought by the chief, the son of Æson? Then will the verses perish of the sublime Lucretius, [233] when the same day shall give the world to destruction. Tityrus, [234] and the harvests, and the arms of Æneas, will be read of, so long as thou, Rome, [235] shalt be the ruler of the conquered earth. So long as the flames and the bow shall be the arms of Cupid, thy numbers, polished Tibullus, [236] will be repeated. Gallus [237] _will be known_ by the West, and Gallus _known_ by the East, [238] and with Gallus will his Lycoris be known. Though flint-stones, then, _and_ though the share of the enduring plough perish by lapse of time, _yet_ poetry is exempt from death. Let monarchs and the triumphs of monarchs yield to poesy, and let the wealthy shores of the golden Tagus [239] yield. Let the vulgar throng admire worthless things; let the yellow-haired Apollo supply for me cups filled from the Castalian stream; let me bear, too, on my locks the myrtle that dreads the cold; and let me often be read by the anxious lover. Envy feeds upon the living; after death it is at rest, when his own reward protects each according to his merit. Still then, when the closing fire [240] shall have consumed me, shall I live on; and a great portion of myself will _ever_ be surviving. BOOK THE SECOND ELEGY I. _He says that he is obliged by Cupid to write of Love instead of the Wars, of the Giants, upon which subject he had already commenced._ |This work, also, I, Naso, born among the watery Peligni, [301] have composed, the Poet of my own failings. This work, too, has Love demanded. Afar hence, be afar hence, ye prudish matrons; you are not a fitting audience for my wanton lines. Let the maiden that is not cold, read me in the presence of her betrothed; the inexperienced boy, too, wounded by a passion hitherto unknown; and may some youth, now wounded by the bow by which I am, recognise the conscious symptoms of his flame; and after long wondering, may he exclaim, \"Taught by what informant, has this Poet been composing my own story?\" I was (I remember) venturing to sing of the battles of the heavens, and Gyges [302] with his hundred hands; and I had sufficient power of expression; what time the Earth so disgracefully avenged herself, and lofty Ossa, heaped upon Olympus, bore Pelion headlong downwards. Having the clouds in my hands, and wielding the lightnings with Jove, which with success he was to hurl in behalf of his realms of the heavens, my mistress shut her door against me; the lightnings together with Jove did I forsake. Jupiter himself disappeared from my thoughts. Pardon me, O Jove; no aid did thy weapons afford me; the shut door was a more potent thunderbolt than thine. I forthwith resumed the language of endearment and trifling Elegies, those weapons of my own; and gentle words prevailed upon the obdurate door.

Through verses do serpents burst, their jaws rent asunder, and the water turned back flows upward to its source. Through verses have doors given way; and by verses [304] was the bar, inserted in the door-post, although 'twas made of oak, overcome. Of what use is the swift Achilles celebrated by me? What can this or that son of Atreus do for me? He, too, who wasted as many of his years in wandering as in warfare? And the wretched Hector, dragged by the Hæmonian steeds? But the charms of the beauteous fair being ofttimes sung, she presents herself to the Poet as the reward of his verse. This great recompense is given; farewell, then, ye illustrious names of heroes; your favour is of no use to me. Ye charming fair, turn your eyes to my lines, which blushing Cupid dictates to me. ELEGY II. _He has seen a lady walking in the portico of the temple of Apollo, and has sent to know if he may wait upon her. She has replied that it is quite impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her. Ovid here addresses Bagous, and endeavours to persuade him to relax his watch over the fair; and shows him how he can do so with safety._ |Bagous, [305] with whom is the duty of watching over your mistress, give me your attention, while I say a few but suitable words to you. Yesterday morning I saw a young lady walking in that portico which contains the choir _of the daughters_ of Danaus. [306] At once, as she pleased me, I sent _to her_, and in my letter I proffered my request; with trembling hand, she answered me, \"I cannot.\" And to my inquiry, why she could not, the cause was announced; _namely_, that your surveillance over your mistress is too strict. O keeper, if you are wise (believe me _now_), cease to deserve my hatred; every one wishes him gone, of whom he stands in dread. Her husband, too, is not in his senses; for who would toil at taking care of that of which no part is lost, even if you do not watch it? But _still_, in his madness, let him indulge his passion; and let him believe that the object is chaste which pleases universally. By your favour, liberty may by stealth be given to her; that _one day_ she may return to you what you have given her. Are you ready to be a confidant; the mistress is obedient to the slave. You fear to be an accomplice; you may shut your eyes. Does she read a letter by herself; suppose her mother to have sent it. Does a stranger come; bye and bye let him go, [307] _as though_ an _old_ acquaintance. Should she go to visit a sick female friend, who is not sick; in your opinion, let her be unwell. If she shall be a long time at the sacrifice, [308] let not the long waiting tire you; putting your head on your breast, you can snore away. And don't be enquiring what can be going on at _the temple of_ the linen-clad Isis; [309] nor do you stand in any fear _whatever_ of the curving theatres. An accomplice in the escapade will receive everlasting honour; and what is less trouble than _merely_ to hold your tongue? He is in favour; he turns the house [310] upside down _at his pleasure_, and he feels no stripes; he is omnipotent; the rest, a scrubby lot, are grovelling on. By him, that the real circumstances may be concealed, false ones are coined; and both the masters approve [311] of, what one, _and that the mistress_, Approves of. When the husband has quite contracted his brow, and has pursed up his wrinkles, the caressing fair makes him become just as she pleases. But still, let her sometimes contrive some fault against you even, and let her pretend tears, and call you an executioner. [312] Do you, on the other hand, making some charge which she may easily explain; by a feigned accusation remove all suspicion of the truth. [313] In such case, may your honours, then may your limited savings [314] increase; _only_ do this, and in a short time you shall be a free man. You behold the chains bound around the necks of informers; [315] the loathsome gaol receives the hearts that are unworthy of belief. In the midst of water Tantalus is in want of water, and catches at the apples as they escape him; 'twas his blabbing tongue caused this.

[325] While the keeper appointed by Juno, [326] is watching Io too carefully, he dies before his time; she becomes a Goddess. I have seen him wearing fetters on his bruised legs, through whom a husband was obliged to know of an intrigue. The punishment was less than his deserts; an unruly tongue was the injury of the two; the husband was grieved; the female suffered the loss of her character. Believe me; accusations are pleasing to no husband, and no one do they delight, even though he should listen to them. If he is indifferent, then you are wasting your information upon ears that care nothing for it; if he dotes _on her_, by your officiousness is he made wretched. Besides, a faux pas, although discovered, is not so easily proved; she comes _before him_, protected by the prejudices of her judge. Should even he himself see it, still he himself will believe her as she denies it; and he will condemn his own eyesight, and will impose upon himself. Let him _but_ see the tears of his spouse, and he himself will weep, and he will say, \"That blabbing fellow shall be punished.\" How unequal the contest in which you embark! if conquered, stripes are ready for you; _while_ she is reposing in the bosom of the judge. No crime do we meditate; we meet not for mixing poisons; my hand is not glittering with the drawn sword. We ask that through you we may be enabled to love in safety; what can there be more harmless than these our prayers? ELEGY III. _He again addresses Bagous, who has proved obdurate to his request, and tries to effect his object by sympathising with his unhappy fate._ |Alas! that, [327] neither man nor woman, you are watching your mistress, and that you cannot experience the mutual transports of love! He who was the first to mutilate boys, [328] ought himself to have suffered those wounds which he made. You would be ready to accommodate, and obliging to those who entreat you, had your own passion been before inflamed by any fair. You were not born for _managing_ the steed, nor _are you_ skilful in valorous arms; for your right hand the warlike spear is not adapted. With these let males meddle; do you resign _all_ manly aspirations; may the standard be borne [329] by you in the cause of your mistress. Overwhelm her with your favours; her gratitude may be of use to you. If you should miss that, what good fortune will there be for you? She has both beauty, _and_ her years are fitted for dalliance; her charms are not deserving to fade in listless neglect. Ever watchful though you are deemed, _still_ she may deceive you; what two persons will, does not fail of accomplishment. Still, as it is more convenient to try you with our entreaties, we do implore you, while you have _still_ the opportunity of conferring your favours to advantage. [330] ELEGY IV. _He confesses that he is an universal admirer of the fair sex._ |I would not presume to defend my faulty morals, and to wield deceiving arms in behalf of my frailties. I confess them, if there is any use in confessing one's errors; and now, having confessed, I am foolishly proceeding to my own accusation. I hate _this state_; nor, though I wish, can I be otherwise than what I hate. Alas! how hard it is to bear _a lot_ which you wish to lay aside! For strength and self-control fail me for ruling myself; just like a ship carried along the rapid tide, am I hurried away. There is no single style of beauty which inflames my passion; there are a hundred causes for me always to be in love. Is there any fair one that casts down her modest eyes? I am on fire; and that very modesty becomes an ambush against me. Is another one forward; _then_ I am enchanted, because she is not coy; and her liveliness raises all my expectations. If another seems to be prudish, and to imitate the repulsive Sabine dames; [332] I think that she is kindly disposed, but that she conceals it in her stateliness. [333] Or if you are a learned fair, you please me, _thus_ endowed with rare acquirements; or if ignorant, you are charming for your simplicity. Is there one who says that the lines of Callimachus are uncouth in comparison with mine; at once she, to whom I am _so_ pleasing, pleases me. Is there even one who abuses both myself, the Poet, and my lines; I could wish to have her who so abuses me, upon my knee. Does this one walk leisurely, she enchants me with her gait; is another uncouth, still, she may become more gentle, on being more intimate with the other sex. Because this one sings _so_ sweetly, and modulates her voice [334] with such extreme case, I could wish to steal a kiss from her as she sings. Another is running through the complaining strings with active finger; who could not fall in love with hands so skilled? _And now_, one pleases by her gestures, and moves her arms to time, [335] and moves her graceful sides with languishing art _in the dance_; to say nothing about myself, who am excited on every occasion, put Hippolytus [336] there; he would become a Priapus.

You, because you are so tall, equal the Heroines of old; [337] and, of large size, you can fill the entire couch as you lie. Another is active from her shortness; by both I am enchanted; both tall and short suit my taste. Is one unadorned; it occurs what addition there might be if she was adorned. Is one decked out; she sets out her endowments to advantage. The blonde will charm me; the brunette [338] will charm me _too_; a Venus is pleasing, even of a swarthy colour. Does black hair fall upon a neck of snow; Leda was sightly, with her raven locks. Is the hair flaxen; with her saffron locks, Aurora was charming. To every traditional story does my passion adapt itself. A youthful age charms me; _an age_ more mature captivates me; the former is superior in the charms of person, the latter excels in spirit. In fine, whatever the fair any person approves of in all the City, to all these does my passion aspire. ELEGY V. _He addresses his mistress, whom he has detected acting falsely towards him._ |Away with thee, quivered Cupid: no passion is of a value so great, that it should so often be my extreme wish to die. It is my wish to die, as oft as I call to mind your guilt. Fair one, born, alas! to be a never-ceasing cause of trouble! It is no tablets rubbed out [339] that discover your doings; no presents stealthily sent reveal your criminality. Oh! would that I might so accuse you, that, _after all_, I could not convict you! Ah wretched me! _and_ why is my case so stare? Happy _the man_ who boldly dares to defend the object which he loves; to whom his mistress is able to say, \"I have done nothing _wrong_.\" Hard-hearted _is he_, and too much does he encourage his own grief, by whom a blood-stained victory is sought in the conviction of the accused. To my sorrow, in my sober moments, with the wine on table, [342] I myself was witness of your criminality, when you thought I was asleep. I saw you _both_ uttering many an expression by moving your eyebrows; [343] in your nods there was a considerable amount of language. Your eyes were not silent, [344] the table, too, traced over with wine; [345] nor was the language of the fingers wanting; I understood your discourse, [346] which treated of that which it did not appear to do; the words, too, preconcerted to stand for certain meanings. And now, the tables removed, many a guest had gone away; a couple of youths _only_ were _there_ dead drunk. But then I saw you _both_ giving wanton kisses; I am sure that there was billing enough on your part; such, _in fact_, as no sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but _rather such_ as some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may suppose that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time save to her own _dear_ Mars. \"What are you doing?\" I cried out; \"whither are you taking those transports that belong to me? On what belongs to myself, I will lay the hand of a master, [347] These _delights_ must be in common with you and me, _and_ with me and you; _but_ why does any third person take a share in them?\" This did I say; and what, _besides_, sorrow prompted my tongue to say; but the red blush of shame rose on her conscious features; just as the sky, streaked by the wife of Tithonus, is tinted with red, or the maiden when beheld by her new-made husband; [348] just as the roses are beauteous when mingled among their _encircling_ lilies; or when the Moon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; [349] or the Assyrian ivory [350] which the Mæonian woman has stained, [351] that from length of time it may not turn yellow. That complexion _of hers_ was extremely like to these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never was more beauteous _than then_. She looked towards the ground; to look upon the ground, added a charm; sad were her features, in her sorrow was she graceful. I had been tempted to tear her locks just as they were, (and nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender cheeks. When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of her own was my mistress defended.

To my misery I am _now_ tormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and I hope that those were not of this quality. [352] Those _kisses,_ too, were far better than those which I taught her; and she seemed to have learned something new. That they were too delightful, is a bad sign; that so lovingly were your lips joined to mine, _and_ mine to yours. And yet, it is not at this alone that I am grieved; I do not only complain that kisses were given; although I do complain as well that they were given; such could never have been taught but on a closer acquaintanceship. I know not who is the master that has received a remuneration so ample. ELEGY VI. _He laments the death of the parrot which he had given to Corinna._ |The parrot, the imitative bird [353] sent from the Indians of the East, is dead; come in flocks to his obsequies, ye birds. Come, affectionate denizens of air, and beat your breasts with your wings; and with your hard claws disfigure your delicate features. Let your rough feathers be torn in place of your sorrowing hair; instead of the long trumpet, [354] let your songs resound. Why, Philomela, are you complaining of the cruelty of _Tereus,_ the Ismarian tyrant? _Surely,_ that grievance is worn out by its _length of_ years. Turn your attention to the sad end of a bird so prized. It is is a great cause of sorrow, but, _still,_ that so old. All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord. See, the quails, amid _all_ their battles, [363] live on; perhaps, too, for that reason, they become old. With a very little you were satisfied; and, through your love of talking, you could not give time to your mouth for much food. A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of sleep; and a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst. The gluttonous vulture lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and the jackdaw, the foreboder [364] of the shower of rain. The crow, too, lives on, hateful to the armed Minerva; [366] it, indeed, will hardly die after nine ages. [367] The prattling parrot is dead, the mimic of the human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth. What is best, is generally first carried off by greedy hands; what is worthless, fills its _destined_ numbers. [368] Thersites was the witness of the lamented death of him from Phylax; and now Hector became ashes, while his brothers _yet_ lived. Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind? The seventh day was come, [369] that was doomed to give no morrow; and now stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered. And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.

I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress, who suspects the contrary, that he is not in love with her handmaid Cypassis._ |Am I then [378] 'to be for ever made the object of accusation by new charges? Though I should conquer, _yet_ I am tired of entering the combat so oft. Do I look up to the _very_ top of the marble theatre, from the multitude, you choose some woman, from whom to receive a cause of grief. Or does some beauteous fair look on me with inexpressive features; you find out that there are secret signs on the features. Do I praise any one; with your nails you attack her ill-starred locks; if I blame any one, you think I am hiding some fault. If my colour is healthy, _then I am pronounced_ to be indifferent towards you; if unhealthy, _then_ I am said to be dying with love for another. But I _only_ wish I was conscious to myself of some fault; those endure punishment with equanimity, who are deserving of it. Now you accuse me without cause; and by believing every thing at random, you yourself forbid your anger to be of any consequence. See how the long-eared ass, [379] in his wretched lot, walks leisurely along, _although_ tyrannized over with everlasting blows. _And_ lo! a fresh charge; Cypassis, so skilled at tiring, [380] is blamed for having been the supplanter of her mistress. May the Gods prove more favourable, than that if I should have any inclination for a faux pas, a low-born mistress of a despised class should attract me! What free man would wish to have amorous intercourse with a bondwoman, and to embrace a body mangled with the whip? [387] Add, _too_, that she is skilled in arranging your hair, and is a valuable servant to you for the skill of her hands. And would I, forsooth, ask _such a thing_ of a servant, who is so faithful to you? _And_ for why? Only that a refusal might be united to a betrayal? I swear by Venus, and by the bow of the winged boy, that I am accused of a crime which I never committed. ELEGY VIII. _He wonders how Corinna has discovered his intrigue with Cypassis, her handmaid, and tells the latter how ably he has defended her and himself to her mistress._ |Cypassis, perfect in arranging the hair in a thousand fashions, but deserving to adorn the Goddesses alone; discovered, too, by me, in our delightful intrigue, to be no novice; useful, indeed, to your mistress, but still more serviceable to myself; who, _I wonder_, was the informant of our stolen caresses? \"Whence was Corinna made acquainted with your escapade? Is it that I have blushed? Is it that, making a slip in any expression, I have given any guilty sign of our stealthy amours? And have I _not_, too, declared that if any one can commit the sin with a bondwoman, that man must want a sound mind? The Thessalian was inflamed by the beauty of the captive daughter of Brises; the slave priestess of Phoebus was beloved by the general from Mycenæ. I am not greater than the descendant of Tantalus, nor greater than Achilles; why should I deem that a disgrace to me, which was becoming for monarchs? But when she fixed her angry eyes upon you, I saw you blushing all over your cheeks. But, if, perchance, you remember, with how much more presence of mind did I myself make oath by the great Godhead of Venus! Do thou, Goddess, do thou order the warm South winds to bear away over the Carpathian ocean [388] the perjuries of a mind unsullied. In return for these services, swarthy Cypassis, [389] give me a sweet reward, your company to-day. Why refuse me, ungrateful one, and why invent new apprehensions? 'Tis enough to have laid one of your superiors under an obligation. But if, in your folly, you refuse me, as the informer, I will tell what has taken place before; and I myself will be the betrayer of my own failing. And I will tell Cypassis, in what spots I have met you, and how often, and in ways how many and what. ELEGY IX. _To Cupid._ O Cupid, never angered enough against me, O boy, that hast taken up thy abode in my heart! why dost thou torment me, who, _thy_ soldier, have never deserted thy standards?

And _why_, in my own camp, am I _thus_ wounded? Why does thy torch burn, thy bow pierce, thy friends? 'Twere a greater glory to conquer those who war _with thee_. Nay more, did not the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his healing aid, whom he had struck with his spear. [390] The hunter follows _the prey_ that flies, that which is caught he leaves behind; and he is ever on the search for still more than he has found. We, a multitude devoted to thee, are _too well_ acquainted with thy arms; _yet_ thy tardy hand slackens against the foe that resists. Of what use is it to be blunting thy barbed darts against bare bones? _for_ Love has left my bones _quite_ bare. Many a man is there free from Love, many a damsel, too, free from Love; from these, with great glory, may a triumph be obtained by thee. Rome, had she not displayed her strength over the boundless earth, would, even to this day, have been planted thick with cottages of thatch. [391] The invalid soldier is drafted off to the fields [392] that he has received; the horse, when free from the race, [393] is sent into the pastures; the lengthened docks conceal the ship laid up; and the wand of repose [394] is demanded, the sword laid by. It were time for me, too, who have served so oft in love for the fair, now discharged, to be living in quiet. _And yet_, if any Divinity were to say to me, 'Live on, resigning love I should decline it; so sweet an evil are the fair. When I am quite exhausted, and the passion has faded from my mind, I know not by what perturbation of my wretched feelings I am bewildered. Just as the horse that is hard of mouth bears his master headlong, as he vainly pulls in the reins covered with foam; just as a sudden gale, the land now nearly made, carries out to sea the vessel, as she is entering harbour; so, many a time, does the uncertain gale of Cupid bear me away, and rosy Love resumes his well-known weapons. Pierce me, boy; naked am I exposed to thee, my arms laid aside; hither let thy strength be _directed_: here thy right hand tells _with effect_. Here, as though bidden, do thy arrows now spontaneously come; in comparison to myself, their own quiver is hardly so well known to them. Wretched is he who endures to rest the whole night, and who calls slumber a great good. Fool, what is slumber but the image of cold death? The Fates will give abundance of time for taking rest. Only let the words of my deceiving mistress beguile me; in hoping, at least, great joys shall I experience. And sometimes let her use caresses; sometimes let her find fault; oft may I enjoy _the favour_ of my mistress; often may I be repulsed. That Mars is one so dubious, is through thee, his step-son, Cupid; and after thy example does thy step-father wield his arms. Thou art fickle, and much more wavering than thy own wings; and thou both dost give and refuse thy joys at thy uncertain caprice. Still if thou dost listen to me, as I entreat thee, with thy beauteous mother; hold a sway never to be relinquished in my heart. May the damsels, a throng too flighty _by far_, be added to thy realms; then by two peoples wilt thou be revered. ELEGY X. _He tells Græcinus how he is in love with two mistresses at the same time._ |Thou wast wont to tell me, Græcinus [395] (I remember well), 'twas thou, I am sure, that a person cannot be in love with two females at the same time. Through thee have I been deceived; through thee have I been caught without my arms. [396] Lo! to my shame, I am in love with two at the same moment. Both of them are charming; both most attentive to their dress; in skill, 'tis a matter of doubt, whether the one or the other is superior. That one is more beauteous than this; this one, too, is more beauteous than that; and this one pleases me the most, and that one the most. The one passion and the other fluctuate, like the skiff, [397] impelled by the discordant breezes, and keep me distracted. Why, Erycina, dost thou everlastingly double my pangs? Was not one damsel sufficient for my anxiety? Why add leaves to the trees, why stars to the heavens filled _with them?_ Why additional waters to the vast ocean? But still this is better, than if I were languishing without a flame; may a life of seriousness be the lot of my foes. May it be the lot of my foes to sleep in the couch of solitude, and to recline their limbs outstretched in the midst of the bed. But, for me, may cruel Love _ever_ disturb my sluggish slumbers; and may I be not the solitary burden of my couch. May my mistress, with no one to hinder it, make me die _with love_, if one is enough to be able to do so; _but_ if one is not enough, _then_ two.

Limbs that are thin, [401] but not without strength, may suffice; flesh it is, not sinew that my body is in want of. Delight, too, will give resources for vigour to my sides; through me has no fair ever been deceived. Often, robust through the hours of delicious night, have I proved of stalwart body, even in the mom. Happy the man, who proves the delights of Love? Oh that the Gods would grant that to be the cause of my end! Let the soldier arm his breast [402] that faces the opposing darts, and with his blood let him purchase eternal fame. Let the greedy man seek wealth; and with forsworn mouth, let the shipwrecked man drink of the seas which he has wearied with ploughing them. But may it be my lot to perish in the service of Love: _and_, when I die, may I depart in the midst of his battles; [403] and may some one say, when weeping at my funeral rites: \"Such was a fitting death for his life.\" ELEGY XI. _He endeavours to dissuade Corinna from her voyage to Baiæ._ |The pine, cut on the heights of Pelion, was the first to teach the voyage full of danger, as the waves of the ocean wondered: which, boldly amid the meeting rocks, [404] bore away the ram remarkable for his yellow fleece. Oh! would that, overwhelmed, the Argo had drunk of the fatal waves, so that no one might plough the wide main with the oar. Lo! Corinna flies from both the well-known couch, and the Penates of her home, and prepares to go upon the deceitful paths _of the ocean_. Ah wretched me! why, for you, must I dread the Zephyrs, and the Eastern gales, and the cold Boreas, and the warm wind of the South? There no cities will you admire, _there_ no groves; _ever_ the same is the azure appearance of the perfidious main. The midst of the ocean has no tiny shells, or tinted pebbles; [405] that is the recreation [406] of the sandy shore. The shore _alone_, ye fair, should be pressed with your marble feet. Thus far is it safe; the rest of _that_ path is full of hazard. And let others tell you of the warfare of the winds: the waves which Scylla infests, or those which Charybdis _haunts_: from what rocky range the deadly Ceraunia projects: in what gulf the Syrtes, or in what Malea [407] lies concealed. Of these let others tell: but do you believe what each of them relates: no storm injures the person who credits them. After a length of time _only_ is the land beheld once more, when, the cable loosened, the curving ship runs out upon the boundless main: where the anxious sailor dreads the stormy winds, and _sees_ death as near him, as he sees the waves. What if Triton arouses the agitated waves? How parts the colour, then, from all your face! Then you may invoke the gracious stars of the fruitful Leda: [409] and may say, 'Happy she, whom her own _dry_ land receives!'Tis far more safe to lie snug in the couch, [410] to read amusing books, [411] _and_ to sound with one's fingers the Thracian lyre. But if the headlong gales bear away my unavailing words, still may Galatea be propitious to your ship. The loss of such a damsel, both ye Goddesses, daughters of Nereus, and thou, father of the Nereids, would be a reproach to you. Go, mindful of me, on your way, _soon_ to return with favouring breezes: may that, a stronger gale, fill your sails. Then may the mighty Nereus roll the ocean towards this shore: in this direction may the breezes blow: hither may the tide impel the waves. Do you yourself entreat, that the Zephyrs may come full upon your canvass: do you let out the swelling sails with your own hand. I shall be the first, from the shore, to see the well-known ship, and I shall exclaim, \"'Tis she that carries my Divinities: [412] and I will receive you in my arms, and will ravish, indiscriminately, many a kiss; the victim, promised for your return, shall fall; the soft sand shall be heaped, too, in the form of a couch; and some sand-heap shall be as a table [413] _for us_.

May Lucifer, the most brilliant in the lofty skies, speedily bring me that day, spurring on his steed.\" ELEGY XII. _He rejoices in the possession of his mistress, having triumphed over every obstacle._ |Come, triumphant laurels, around my temples; I am victorious: lo! in my bosom Corinna is; she, whom her husband, whom a keeper, whom a door _so_ strong, (so many foes!) were watching, that she might by no stratagem be taken. This victory is deserving of an especial triumph: in which the prize, such as it is, is _gained_ without bloodshed. Not lowly walls, not towns surrounded with diminutive trenches, but a _fair_ damsel has been taken by my contrivance. When Pergamus fell, conquered in a war of twice five years: [415] out of so many, how great was the share of renown for the son of Atreus? But my glory is undivided, and shared in by no soldier: and no other has the credit of the exploit. Myself the general, myself the troops, I have attained this end of my desires: I, myself, have been the cavalry, I the infantry, I, the standard-bearer _too_. Fortune, too, has mingled no hazard with my feats. Come hither, _then_, thou Triumph, gained by exertions _entirely_ my own. And the cause [416] of my warfare is no new one; had not the daughter of Tyndarus been carried off, there would have been peace between Europe and Asia. A female disgracefully set the wild Lapithæ and the two-formed race in arms, when the wine circulated. A female again, [417] good Latinus, forced the Trojans to engage in ruthless warfare, in thy realms. 'Twas the females, [421] when even now the City was but new, that sent against the Romans their fathers-in-law, and gave them cruel arms. I have beheld the bulls fighting for a snow-white mate: the heifer, herself the spectator, afforded fresh courage. Me, too, with many others, but still without bloodshed, has Cupid ordered to bear the standard in his service. ELEGY XIII. _He entreats the aid of Isis and Lucina in behalf of Corinna, in her labour._ |While Corinna, in her imprudence, is trying to disengage the burden of her pregnant womb, exhausted, she lies prostrate in danger of her life. She, in truth, who incurred so great a risk unknown to me, is worthy of my wrath; but anger falls before apprehension. But yet, by me it was that she conceived; or so I think. That is often as a fact to me, which is possible. Isis, thou who dost [422] inhabit Parætonium, [423] and the genial fields of Canopus, [424] and Memphis, [425] and palm-bearing Pharos, [426] and where the rapid. Nile, discharged from its vast bed, rushes through its seven channels into the ocean waves; by thy 'sistra' [428] do I entreat thee; by the faces, _too_, of revered Anubis; [429] and then may the benignant Osiris [430] ever love thy rites, and may the sluggish serpent [431] ever wreath around thy altars, and may the horned Apis [432] walk in the procession as thy attendant; turn hither thy features, [433] and in one have mercy upon two; for to my mistress wilt thou be giving life, she to me. Full many a time in thy honour has she sat on thy appointed days, [434] on which [435] the throng of the Galli [436] wreathe _themselves_ with thy laurels. [437] Thou, too, who dost have compassion on the females who are in labour, whose latent burden distends their bodies slowly moving; come, propitious Ilithyia, [438] and listen to my prayers. She is worthy for thee to command to become indebted to thee. I, myself, in white array, will offer frankincense at thy smoking altars; I, myself, will offer before thy feet the gifts that I have vowed. I will add _this_ inscription too; \"Naso, for the preservation of Corinna, _offers these_.\" But if, amid apprehensions so great, I may be allowed to give you advice, let it suffice for you, Corinna, to have struggled in this _one_ combat. ELEGY XIV. _He reproaches his mistress for having attempted to procure abortion._ |Of what use is it for damsels to live at ease, exempt from war, and not with their bucklers, [439] to have any inclination to follow the bloodstained troops; if, without warfare, they endure wounds from weapons of their own, and arm their imprudent hands for their own destruction? She who was the first to teach how to destroy the tender embryo, was deserving to perish by those arms of her own. That the stomach, forsooth, may be without the reproach of wrinkles, the sand must [440] be lamentably strewed for this struggle of yours.

She who was the first to teach how to destroy the tender embryo, was deserving to perish by those arms of her own. That the stomach, forsooth, may be without the reproach of wrinkles, the sand must [440] be lamentably strewed for this struggle of yours. If the same custom had pleased the matrons of old, through _such_ criminality mankind would have perished; and he would be required, who should again throw stones [441] on the empty earth, for the second time the original of our kind. Who would have destroyed the resources of Priam, if Thetis, the Goddess of the waves, had refused to bear _Achilles_, her due burden? If Ilia had destroyed [442] the twins in her swelling womb, the founder of the all-ruling City would have perished. If Venus had laid violent hands on Æneas in her pregnant womb, the earth would have been destitute of _its_ Cæsars. You, too, beauteous one, might have died at the moment you might have been born, if your mother had tried the same experiment which you have done. I, myself, though destined as I am, to die a more pleasing death by love, should have beheld no days, had my mother slain me. Why do you deprive the loaded vine of its growing grapes? And why pluck the sour apples with relentless hand? When ripe, let them fall of their own accord; _once_ put forth, let them grow. Life is no slight reward for a little waiting. Why pierce [443] your own entrails, by applying instruments, and _why_ give dreadful poisons to the _yet_ unborn? People blame the Colchian damsel, stained with the blood of her sons; and they grieve for Itys, Slaughtered by his own mother. Each mother was cruel; but each, for sad reasons, took vengeance on her husband, by shedding their common blood. Tell me what Tereus, or what Jason excites you to pierce your body with an anxious hand? This neither the tigers do in their Armenian dens, [444] nor does the lioness dare to destroy an offspring of her own. But, delicate females do this, not, however, with impunity; many a time [445] does she die herself, who kills her _offspring_ in the womb. She dies herself, and, with her loosened hair, is borne upon the bier; and those whoever only catch a sight of her, cry \"She deserved it.\" [446] But let these words vanish in the air of the heavens, and may there be no weight in _these_ presages of mine. Ye forgiving Deities, allow her this once to do wrong with safety _to herself_; that is enough; let a second transgression bring _its own_ punishment. ELEGY XV. _He addresses a ring which he has presented to his mistress, and envi its happy lot._ |O ring, [447] about to encircle the finger of the beauteous fair, in which there is nothing of value but the affection of the giver; go as a pleasing gift; _and_ receiving you with joyous feelings, may she at once place you upon her finger. May you serve her as well as she is constant to me; and nicely fitting, may you embrace her finger in your easy circle. Happy ring, by my mistress will you be handled. To my sorrow, I am now envying my own presents. O! that I could suddenly be changed into my own present, by the arts of her of Ææa, or of the Carpathian old man! [448] Then could I wish you to touch the bosom of my mistress, and for her to place her left hand within her dress. Though light and fitting well, I would escape from her finger; and loosened by _some_ wondrous contrivance, into her bosom would I fall. I too, _as well_, that I might be able to seal [449] her secret tablets, and that the seal, neither sticky nor dry, might not drag the wax, should first have to touch the lips [450] of the charming fair. Only I would not seal a note, the cause of grief to myself. Should I be given, to be put away in her desk, [459] I would refuse to depart, sticking fast to your fingers with ray contracted circle. To you, my life, I would never be a cause of disgrace, or a burden which your delicate fingers would refuse to carry. Wear me, when you are bathing your limbs in the tepid stream; and put up with the inconvenience of the water getting beneath the stone. But, I doubt, that _on seeing you_ naked, my passion would be aroused; and that, a ring, I should enact the part of the lover. _But_ why wish for impossibilities?

Though the Sun should cleave the earth with his approaching rays, and though the oppressive Constellation [462] of the Dog of Icarus should shine, the Pelignian fields are traversed by flowing streams, and the shooting grass is verdant on the soft ground. The earth is fertile in corn, and much more fruitful in the grape; the thin soil [463] produces, too, the olive, that bears its berries. [464] The rivers also trickling amid the shooting blades, the grassy turfs cover the moistened ground. But my flame is far away. In one word, I am mistaken; she who excites my flame is far off; my flame is here. I would not choose, could I be placed between Pollux and Castor, to be in a portion of the heavens without yourself. Let them lie with their anxious cares, and let them be pressed with the heavy weight of the earth, who have measured out the earth into lengthened tracks. [465] Or else they should have bid the fair to go as the companions of the youths, if the earth must be measured out into lengthened tracks. Then, had I, shivering, had to pace the stormy Alps, [466] the journey would have been pleasant, so that _I had been_ with my love. With my love, I could venture to rush through the Libyan quicksands, and to spread my sails to be borne along by the fitful Southern gales. _Then_, I would not dread the monsters which bark beneath the thigh of the virgin _Scylla_; nor winding Malea, thy bays; nor where Charybdis, sated with ships swallowed up, disgorges them, and sucks up again the water which she has discharged. And if the sway of the winds prevails, and the waves bear away the Deities about to come to our aid; do you throw your snow-white arms around my shoulders; with active body will I support the beauteous burden. The youth who visited Hero, had often swam across the waves; then, too, would he have crossed them, but the way was dark. But without you, although the fields affording employment with their vines detain me; although the meadows be overflowed by the streams, and _though_ the husbandman invite the obedient stream [467] into channels, and the cool air refresh the foliage of the trees, I should not seem to be among the healthy Peliguians; I _should_ not _seem to be in_ the place of my birth--my paternal fields; but in Scythia, and among the fierce Cilicians, [468] and the Britons _painted_ green, [469] and the rocks which are red with the gore of Prometheus. The elm loves the vine, [471] the vine forsakes not the elm: why am I _so_ often torn away from my love? But you used to swear, _both_ by myself, and by your eyes, my stars, that you would ever be my companion. The winds and the waves carry away, whither they choose, the empty words of the fair, more worthless than the falling leaves. Still, if there is any affectionate regard in you for me _thus_ deserted: _now_ commence to add deeds to your promises: and forthwith do you, as the nags [472] whirl your little chaise [473] along, shake the reins over their manes at full speed. But you, rugged hills, subside, wherever she shall come; and you paths in the winding vales, be smooth. ELEGY XVII. _He says that he is the slave of Corinna, and complains of the tyranny which she exercises over him._ |If there shall be any one who thinks it inglorious to serve a damsel: in his opinion I shall be convicted of such baseness. Let me be disgraced; if only she, who possesses Paphos, and Cythera, beaten by the waves, torments me with less violence. And would that I had been the prize, too, of some indulgent mistress; since I was destined to be the prize of some fair. Beauty begets pride; through her charms Corinna is disdainful. Ah wretched me! why is she so well known to herself? Pride, forsooth, is caught from the reflection of the mirror: and _there_ she sees not herself, unless she is first adorned. If your beauty gives you a sway not too great over all things, face born to fascinate my eyes, still, you ought not, on that account, to despise me comparatively with yourself. That which is inferior must be united with what is great. The Nymph Calypso, seized with passion for a mortal, is believed to have detained the hero against his will. It is believed that the ocean-daughter of Nereus was united to the king of Plithia, [474] _and_ that Egeria was to the just Numa: that Venus was to Vulcan: although, his anvil [475] left, he limped with a distorted foot. This same kind of verse is unequal; but still the heroic is becomingly united [476] with the shorter measure. You, too, my life, receive me upon any terms. May it become you to impose conditions in the midst of your caresses.

[477] May my cheerful lines be to you in place of great wealth: even many a fair wishes to gain fame through me. I know of one who publishes it that she is Corinna. [478] What would she not be ready to give to be so? But neither do the cool Eurotas, and the poplar-bearing Padus, far asunder, roll along the same banks; nor shall any one but yourself be celebrated in my poems. You, alone, shall afford subject-matter for my genius. ELEGY XVIII. _He tells Macer that he ought to write on Love._ |While thou art tracing thy poem onwards [479] to the wrath of Achilles, and art giving their first arms to the heroes, after taking the oaths; I, Macer, [480] am reposing in the shade of Venus, unused to toil; and tender Love attacks me, when about to attempt a mighty subject. Many a time have I said to my mistress, \"At length, away with you:\" _and_ forthwith she has seated herself in my lap. Many a time have I said, \"I am ashamed _of myself:\" when,_ with difficulty, her tears repressed, she has said, \"Ah wretched me! Now you are ashamed to love.\" And _then_ she has thrown her arms around my neck: and has given me a thousand kisses, which _quite_ overpowered me. I am overcome: and my genius is called away from the arms it has assumed; and I _forthwith_ sing the exploits of my home, and my own warfare. Still did I wield the sceptre: and by my care my Tragedy grew apace; [481] and for this pursuit I was well prepared. Love smiled both at my tragic pall, and my coloured buskins, and the sceptre wielded so well by a private hand. From this pursuit, too, did the influence of my cruel mistress draw me away, and Love triumphed over the Poet with his buskins. As I am allowed _to do_, either I teach the art of tender love, (alas! by my own precepts am I myself tormented:) or I write what was delivered to Ulysses in the words of Penelope, or thy tears, deserted Phyllis. What, _too_, Paris and Macareus, and the ungrateful Jason, and the parent of Hip-polytus, and Hippolytus _himself_ read: and what the wretched Dido says, brandishing the drawn sword, and what the Lesbian mistress of the Æolian lyre. How swiftly did my friend, Sabinus, return [482] from all quarters of the world, and bring back letters [483] from different spots! The fair Penelope recognized the seal of Ulysses: the stepmother read what was written by her own Hippolytus. Then did the dutiful Æneas write an answer to the afflicted Elissa; and Phyllis, if she only survives, has something to read. The sad letter came to Hypsipyle from Jason: the Lesbian damsel, beloved _by Apollo_, may give the lyre that she has vowed to Phoebus. [484] Nor, Macer, so far as it is safe for a poet who sings of wars, is beauteous Love unsung of by thee, in the midst of warfare. Both Paris is there, and the adultress, the far-famed cause of guilt: and Laodamia, who attends her husband in death. If well I know thee; thou singest not of wars with greater pleasure than these; and from thy own camp thou comest back to mine. ELEGY XIX. _He tells a husband who does not care for his wife to watch her a little more carefully._ |If, fool, thou dost not need the fair to be well watched; still have her watched for my sake: that I may be pleased with her the more. What one may have is worthless; what one may not have, gives the more edge to the desires. If a man falls in love with that which another permits him _to love_, he is a man without feeling. Let us that love, both hope and fear in equal degree; and let an occasional repulse make room for our desires. Why should I _think of_ Fortune, should she never care to deceive me? I value nothing that does not sometimes cause me pain. The clever Corinna saw this failing in me; and she cunningly found out the means by which I might be enthralled. Oh, how many a time, feigning a pain in her head [485] that was quite well, has she ordered me, as I lingered with tardy foot, to take my departure!

Oh, how many a time has she feigned a fault, and guilty _herself,_ has made there to be an appearance of innocence, just as she pleased! When thus she had tormented me and had rekindled the languid flame, again was she kind and obliging to my wishes. What caresses, what delightful words did she have ready for me! What kisses, ye great Gods, and how many, used she to give me! You, too, who have so lately ravished my eyes, often stand in dread of treachery, often, when entreated, refuse; and let me, lying prostrate on the threshold before your door-posts, endure the prolonged cold throughout the frosty night. Thus is my love made lasting, and it grows up in lengthened experience; this is for my advantage, this forms food for my affection. A surfeit of love, [486] and facilities too great, become a cause of weariness to me, just as sweet food cloys the appetite. If the brazen tower had never enclosed Danaë, [487] Danaë had never been made a mother by Jove. While Juno is watching Io 'with her curving horns, she becomes still more pleasing to Jove than she has been _before_. Whoever desires what he may have, and what is easily obtained, let him pluck leaves from the trees, and take water from the ample stream. If any damsel wishes long to hold her sway, let her play with her lover. Alas! that I, myself, am tormented through my own advice. Let _constant_ indulgence be the lot of whom it may, it does injury to me: that which pursues, _from it_ I fly; that which flies, I ever pursue. But do thou, too sure of the beauteous fair, begin now at nightfall to close thy house. Begin to enquire who it is that so often stealthily paces thy threshold? Why, _too_, the dogs bark [488] in the silent night. Whither the careful handmaid is carrying, or whence bringing back, the tablets? Why so oft she lies in her couch apart? Let this anxiety sometimes gnaw into thy very marrow; and give some scope and some opportunity for my stratagems. If one could fall in love with the wife of a fool, that man could rob the barren sea-shore of its sand. And now I give thee notice; unless thou begin to watch this fair, she shall begin to cease to be a flame of mine. I have put up with much, and that for a long time; I have often hoped that it would come to pass, that I should adroitly deceive thee, when thou hadst watched her well. Thou art careless, and dost endure what should be endured by no husband; but an end there shall be of an amour that is allowed to me. And shall I then, to my sorrow, forsooth, never be forbidden admission? Will it ever be night for me, with no one for an avenger? Am I to dread nothing? Shall I heave no sighs in my sleep? What have I to do with one so easy, what with such a pander of a husband? By thy own faultiness thou dost mar my joys. Why, then, dost thou not choose some one else, for so great long-suffering to please? If it pleases thee for me to be thy rival, forbid me _to be so_.---- BOOK THE THIRD. ELEGY I. _The Poet deliberates whether he shall continue to write Elegies, or whether he shall turn to Tragedy._ |There stands an ancient grove, and one uncut for many a year; 'tis worthy of belief that a Deity inhabits that spot. In the midst there is a holy spring, and a grotto arched with pumice; and on every side the birds pour forth their sweet complaints. Here, as I was walking, protected by the shade of the trees, I was considering upon what work my Muse should commence. Elegy came up, having her perfumed hair wreathed; and, if I mistake not, one of her feet was longer _than the other_. [501] Her figure was beauteous; her robe of the humblest texture, her garb that of one in love; the fault of her foot was one cause of her gracefulness. Ruthless Tragedy, too, came with her mighty stride; on her scowling brow were her locks; her pall swept the ground. Her left hand held aloft the royal sceptre; the Lydian buskin [502] was the high sandal for her feet. And first she spoke; \"And when will there be an end of thy loving? O Poet, so slow at thy subject matter! Drunken revels [503] tell of thy wanton course of life; the cross roads, as they divide in their many ways, tell of it. Many a time does a person point with his finger at the Poet as he goes along, and say, 'That, that is the man whom cruel Love torments.' Thou art talked of as the story of the whole City, and yet thou dost not perceive it; while, all shame laid aside, thou art boasting of thy feats. 'Twere time to be influenced, touched by a more mighty inspiration; [505] long enough hast thou delayed; commence a greater task. By thy subject thou dost cramp thy genius; sing of the exploits of heroes; then thou wilt say, 'This is the field that is worthy of my genius.' Thy Muse has sportively indited what the charming fair may sing; and thy early youth has been passed amidst its own numbers.

Thy Muse has sportively indited what the charming fair may sing; and thy early youth has been passed amidst its own numbers. Now may I, Roman Tragedy, gain a celebrity by thy means; thy conceptions will satisfy my requirements.\" Thus far _did she speak_; and, supported on her tinted buskins, three or four times she shook her head with its flowing locks. The other one, if rightly I remember, smiled with eyes askance. Am I mistaken, or was there a branch of myrtle in her right hand? \"Why, haughty Tragedy,\" said she, \"dost thou attack me with high-sounding words? And canst thou never be other than severe? Still, thou thyself hast deigned to be excited in unequal numbers! [506] Against me hast thou strived, making use of my own verse. I should not compare heroic measures with my own; thy palaces quite overwhelm my humble abodes. I am a trifler; and with myself, Cupid, my care, is a trifler too; I am no more substantial myself than is my subject-matter. Without myself, the mother of wanton Love were coy; of that Goddess do I show myself the patroness [507] and the confidant. The door which thou with thy rigid buskin canst not unlock, the same is open to my caressing words. And yet I have deserved more power than thou, by putting up with many a thing that would not have been endured by thy haughtiness. \"Through me Corinna learned how, deceiving her keeper, to shake the constancy of the fastened door, [508] and to slip away from her couch, clad in a loose tunic, [509] and in the night to move her feet without a stumble. Or how often, cut in _the wood_, [510] have I been hanging up at her obdurate doors, not fearing to be read by the people as they passed! I remember besides, how, when sent, I have been concealed in the bosom of the handmaid, until the strict keeper had taken his departure. Still further--when thou didst send me as a present on her birthday [511] --but she tore me to pieces, and barbarously threw me in the water close by. I was the first to cause the prospering germs of thy genius to shoot; it has, as my gift, that for which she is now asking thee.\" They had now ceased; on which I began: \"By your own selves, I conjure you both; let my words, as I tremble, be received by unprejudiced ears. Thou, the one, dost grace me with the sceptre and the lofty buskin; already, even by thy contact with my lips, have I spoken in mighty accents. Thou, the other, dost offer a lasting fame to my loves; be propitious, then, and with the long lines unite the short. \"Do, Tragedy, grant a little respite to the Poet. Thou art an everlasting task; the time which she demands is but short.\" Moved by my entreaties, she gave me leave; let tender Love be sketched with hurried hand, while still there is time; from behind [514] a more weighty undertaking presses on. ELEGY II. _To his mistress, in whose company he is present at the chariot races in the Circus Maximus. He describes the race._ |I am not sitting here [515] an admirer of the spirited steeds; [516] still I pray that he who is your favourite may win. I have come here to chat with you, and to be seated by you, [517] that the passion which yea cause may not be unknown to you. You are looking at the race, I _am looking_ at you; let us each look at what pleases us, and so let us each feast our eyes. O, happy the driver [518] of the steeds, whoever he is, that is your favourite; it is then his lot to be the object of your care; might such be my lot; with ardent zeal to be borne along would I press over the steeds as they start from the sacred barrier. [519] And now I would give rein; [520] now with my whip would I lash their backs; now with my inside wheel would I graze the turning-place. [521] If you should be seen by me in my course, then I should stop; and the reins, let go, would fall from my hands. Ah! how nearly was Pelops [522] falling by the lance of him of Pisa, while, Hippodamia, he was gazing on thy face! Still did he prove the conqueror through the favour of his mistress; [523] let us each prove victor through the favour of his charmer. Why do you shrink away in vain? [524] The partition forces us to sit close; the Circus has this advantage [525] in the arrangement of its space.

But do you [526] on the right hand, whoever you are, be accommodating to the fair; she is being hurt by the pressure of your side. And you as well, [527] who are looking on behind us; draw in your legs, if you have _any_ decency, and don't press her back with your hard knees. But your mantle, hanging too low, is dragging on the ground; gather it up; or see, I am taking it up [528] in my hands. A disobliging garment you are, who are thus concealing ancles so pretty; and the more you gaze upon them, the more disobliging garment you are. Such were the ancles of the fleet Atalanta, [529] which Milanion longed to touch with his hands. Such are painted the ancles of the swift Diana, when, herself _still_ bolder, she pursues the bold beasts of prey. On not seeing them, I am on fire; what would be the consequence if they _were seen?_ You are heaping flames upon flames, water upon the sea. From them I suspect that the rest may prove charming, which is so well hidden, concealed beneath the thin dress. But, meanwhile, should you like to receive the gentle breeze which the fan may cause, [530] when waved by my hand? Or is the heat I feel, rather that of my own passion, and not of the weather, and is the love of the fair burning my inflamed breast? While I am talking, your white clothes are sprinkled with the black dust; nasty dust, away from a body like the snow. But now the procession [531] is approaching; give good omens both in words and feelings. The time is come to applaud; the procession approaches, glistening with gold. First in place is Victory borne [532] with expanded wings; [533] come hither, Goddess, and grant that this passion of mine may prove victorious. \"Salute Neptune, [534] you who put too much confidence in the waves; I have nought to do with the sea; my own dry land engages me. Soldier, salute thy own Mars; arms I detest [535] Peace delights me, and Love found in the midst of Peace. Let Phoebus be propitious to the augurs, Phoebe to the huntsmen; turn, Minerva, towards thyself the hands of the artisan. [536] Ye husbandmen, arise in honour of Ceres and the youthful Bacchus; let the boxers [537] render Pollux, the horseman Castor propitious. Thee, genial Venus, and _the Loves_, the boys so potent with the bow, do I salute; be propitious, Goddess, to my aspirations. Inspire, too, kindly feelings in my new mistress; let her permit herself to be loved.\" She has assented; and with her nod she has given a favourable sign. What the Goddess has promised, I entreat yourself to promise. With the leave of Venus I will say it, you shall be the greater Goddess. By these many witnesses do I swear to you, and by this array of the Gods, that for all time you have been sighed for by me. But your legs have no support; you can, if perchance you like, rest the extremities of your feet in the lattice work. [538] Now the Prætor, [539] the Circus emptied, has sent from the even barriers [540] the chariots with their four steeds, the greatest sight of all. I see who is your favourite; whoever you wish well to, he will prove the conqueror. The very horses appear to understand what it is you wish for. Oh shocking! around the turning-place he goes with a circuit _far too_ wide. [541] What art thou about? The next is overtaking thee with his wheel in contact. What, wretched man, art thou about? Thou art wasting the good wishes of the fair; pull in the reins, I entreat, to the left, [542] with a strong hand. We have been resting ourselves in a blockhead; but still, Romans, call him back again, [543] and by waving the garments, [544] give the signal on every side. See! they are calling him back; but that the waving of the garments may not disarrange your hair, [545] you may hide yourself quite down in my bosom. And now, the barrier [546] unbarred once more, the side posts are open wide; with the horses at full speed the variegated throng [547] bursts forth. This time, at all events, [548] do prove victorious, and bound over the wide expanse; let my wishes, let those of my mistress, meet with success. The wishes of my mistress are fulfilled; my wishes still exist. He bears away the palm; [549] the palm is yet to be sought by me. She smiles, and she gives me a promise of something with her expressive eye. That is enough for this spot; grant the rest in another place. ELEGY III. _He complains of his mistress, whom he has found to be forsworn._ |Go to, believe that the Gods exist; she who had sworn has broken her faith, and still her beauty remains [550] just as it was before.

Not yet forsworn, flowing locks had she; after she has deceived the Gods, she has them just as long. Before, she was pale, having her fair complexion suffused with the blush of the rose; the blush is still beauteous on her complexion of snow. Her foot was small; still most diminutive is the size of that foot. Tall was she, and graceful; tall and graceful does she still remain. Expressive eyes had she, which shone like stars; many a time through them has the treacherous fair proved false to me. [551] Even the Gods, forsooth, for ever permit the fair to be forsworn, and beauty has its divine sway. [552] I remember that of late she swore both by her own eyes and by mine, and mine felt pain. [553] Tell me, ye Gods, if with impunity she has proved false to you, why have I suffered, punishment for the deserts of another? But the virgin daughter of Cepheus is no reproach, _forsooth_, to you, [554] who was commanded to die for her mother, so inopportunely beauteous. 'Tis not enough that I had you for witnesses to no purpose; unpunished, she laughs at even the Gods together with myself; that by my punishment she may atone for her perjuries, am I, the deceived, to be the victim of the deceiver? Either a Divinity is a name without reality, and he is revered in vain, and influences people with a silly credulity; or else, _if there is any_ God, he is fond of the charming fair, and gives them alone too much licence to be able to do any thing. Against us Mavors is girded with the fatal sword; against us the lance is directed by the invincible hand of Pallas; against us the flexible bow of Apollo is bent; against us the lofty right hand of Jove wields the lightnings. The offended Gods of heaven fear to hurt the fair; and they spontaneously dread those who dread them not. And who, then, would take care to place the frankincense in his devotion upon the altars? At least, there ought to be more spirit in men. Jupiter, with his fires, hurls at the groves [555] and the towers, and yet he forbids his weapons, thus darted, to strike the perjured female. Many a one has deserved to be struck. The unfortunate Semele [556] perished by the flames; that punishment was found for her by her own compliant disposition. But if she had betaken herself off, on the approach of her lover, his father would not have had for Bacchus the duties of a mother to perform. Why do I complain, and why blame all the heavens? The Gods have eyes as well as we; the Gods have hearts as well. Were I a Divinity myself, I would allow a woman with impunity to swear falsely by my Godhead. I myself would swear that the fair ever swear the truth; and I would not be pronounced one of the morose Divinities. Still, do you, fair one, use their favour with more moderation, or, at least, do have some regard [557] for my eyes. ELEGY IV. _He tells a jealous husband, who watches his wife, that the greater his precautions, the greater are the temptations to sin._ |Cruel husband, by setting a guard over the charming fair, thou dost avail nothing; by her own feelings must each be kept. If, all apprehensions removed, any woman is chaste, she, in fact, is chaste; she who sins not, because she cannot, _still_ sins. [558] However well you may have guarded the person, the mind is still unchaste; and, unless it chooses, it cannot be constrained. You cannot confine the mind, should you lock up every thing; when all is closed, the unchaste one will be within. The one who can sin, errs less frequently; the very opportunity makes the impulse to wantonness to be the less powerful. Be persuaded by me, and leave off instigating to criminality by constraint; by indulgence thou mayst restrain it much more effectually. I have sometimes seen the horse, struggling against his reins, rush on like lightning with his resisting mouth. Soon as ever he felt that rein was given, he stopped, and the loosened bridle lay upon his flowing mane. We are ever striving for what is forbidden, and are desiring what is denied us; even so does the sick man hanker after the water that is forbidden him. Argus used to carry a hundred eyes in his forehead, a hundred in his neck; [559] and these Love alone many a time evaded. Danaë, who, a maid, had been placed in the chamber which was to last for ever with its stone and its iron, [560] became a mother. Penelope, although she was without a keeper, amid so many youthful suitors, remained undefiled. Whatever is hoarded up, we long for it the more, and the very pains invite the thief; few care for what another giants.

Be indignant if thou dost please; forbidden pleasures delight me: if any woman can only say, \"I am afraid, that woman alone pleases me. Nor yet is it legal [561] to confine a free-born woman; let these fears harass the bodies of those from foreign parts. That the keeper, forsooth, may be able to say, 'I caused it she must be chaste for the credit of thy slave. He is too much of a churl whom a faithless wife injures, and is not sufficiently acquainted with the ways of the City; in which Romulus, the son of Ilia, and Remus, the son of Ilia, both begotten by Mars, were not born without a crime being committed. Why didst thou choose a beauty for thyself, if she was not pleasing unless chaste? Those two qualities [562] cannot by any means be united.'\" If thou art wise, show indulgence to thy spouse, and lay aside thy morose looks; and assert not the rights of a severe husband. Show courtesy, too, to the friends thy wife shall find thee, and many a one will she find. 'Tis thus that great credit accrues at a very small outlay of labour. Thus wilt thou be able always to take part in the festivities of the young men, and to see many a thing at home, [563] which you have not presented to her. ELEGY V. _A vision, and its explanation._ |Twas night, and sleep weighed down my wearied eyes. Such a vision as this terrified my mind. Beneath a sunny hill, a grove was standing, thick set with holm oaks; and in its branches lurked full many a bird. A level spot there was beneath, most verdant with the grassy mead, moistened with the drops of the gently trickling stream. Beneath the foliage of the trees, I was seeking shelter from the heat; still, under the foliage of the trees it was hot. Lo! seeking for the grass mingled with the variegated flowers, a white cow was standing before my eyes; more white than the snows at the moment when they have just fallen, which, time has not yet turned into flowing water. More white than the milk which is white with its bubbling foam, [564] and at that moment leaves the ewe when milked. [565] A bull there was, her companion, he, in his happiness, eas her mate; and with his own one he pressed the tender grass. While he was lying, and slowly ruminating upon the grass chewed once again; and once again was feeding on the food eaten by him before; he seemed, as sleep took away his strength, to lay his horned head upon the ground that supported it. Hither came a crow, gliding through the air on light wings; and chattering, took her seat upon the green sward; and thrice with her annoying beak did she peck at the breast of the snow-white cow; and with her bill she took away the white hair. Having remained awhile, she left the spot and the bull; but black envy was in the breast of the cow. And when she saw the bulls afar browsing upon the pastures (bulls were browsing afar upon the verdant pastures), thither did she betake herself, and she mingled among those herds, and sought out a spot of more fertile grass. \"Come, tell me, whoever thou art, thou interpreter of the dreams of the night, what (if it has any truth) this vision means.\" Thus said I: thus spoke the interpreter of the dreams of the night, as he weighed in his mind each particular that was seen; \"The heat which thou didst wish to avoid beneath the rustling leaves, but didst but poorly avoid, was that of Love. The cow is thy mistress; that complexion is suited to the fair. Thou wast the male, and the bull with the fitting mate. Inasmuch as the crow pecked at her breast with her sharp beak; an old hag of a procuress [566] will tempt the affections of thy mistress. In that, after hesitating long, his heifer left the bull, thou wilt be left to be chilled in a deserted couch. Envy and the black spots below the front of her breast, show that she is not free from the reproach of inconstancy.\" Thus spoke the interpreter; the blood retreated from my chilled face; and profound night stood before my eyes. ELEGY VI. _He addresses a river which has obstructed his passage while he is going to his mistress._ |River that hast [567] thy slimy banks planted with reeds, to my mistress I am hastening; stay thy waters for a moment. No bridges hast thou, nor yet a hollow boat [568] to carry one over without the stroke of the oar, by means of the rope thrown across. Thou wast a small stream, I recollect; and I did not hesitate to pass across thee; and the surface of thy waves then hardly reached to my ancles. Now, from the opposite mountain [569] thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in thy turbid stream thou dost pour thy muddied waters. What avails it me thus to have hastened?

Now, from the opposite mountain [569] thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in thy turbid stream thou dost pour thy muddied waters. What avails it me thus to have hastened? What to have given so little time to rest? What to have made the night all one with the day? 569 If still I must be standing here; if, by no contrivance, thy opposite banks are granted to be trodden by my foot. Now do I long for the wings which the hero, the son of Danaë, [570] possessed, when he bore away the head, thickset with the dreadful serpents; now do I wish for the chariot, [571] from which the seed of Ceres first came, thrown upon the uncultivated ground. Of the wondrous fictions of the ancient poets do I speak; no time has produced, nor does produce, nor will produce these wonders. Rather, do thou, stream that dost overflow thy wide banks, flow within thy limits, then for ever mayst thou run on. Torrent, thou wilt not, believe me, be able to endure the reproaches, if perchance I should be mentioned as detained by thee in my love. Rivers ought rather to aid youths in their loves; rivers themselves have experienced what love is. Inachus [572] is said to have flowed pale with love for Melie, [573] the Bithynian Nymph, and to have warmed throughout his cold fords. Not yet was Troy besieged for twice five years, when, Xanthus, Neæra attracted thy eyes. Besides; did not enduring love for the Arcadian maid force Alpheus [574] to run through various lands? They say, too, that thou, Peneus, didst conceal, in the lands of the Phthiotians, Creüsa, [575] already betrothed to Xanthus. Why should I mention Asopus, whom Thebe, beloved by Mars, [576] received, Thebe, destined to be the parent of five daughters? Should I ask of Achelous, \"Where now are thy horns?\" thou wouldst complain that they were broken away by the wrathful hand of Hercules. [577] Not of such value was Calydon, [578] nor of such value was the whole of Ætolia; still, of such value was Deianira alone. The enriching Nile, that flows through his seven mouths, who so well conceals the native spot [579] of waters so vast, is said not to have been able to overpower by his stream the flame that was kindled by Evadne, the daughter of Asopus. [580] Enipeus, dried up, [581] that he might be enabled to embrace the daughter of Salmoneus, bade his waters to depart; his waters, so ordered, did depart. Nor do I pass thee by, who as thou dost roll amid the hollow rocks, foaming, dost water the fields of Argive Tibur [582] whom Ilia [583] captivated, although she was unsightly in her garb, bearing the marks of her nails on her locks, the marks of her nails on her cheeks. Bewailing both the crimes of her uncle, and the fault of Mars, she was wandering along the solitary spots with naked feet. Her the impetuous stream beheld from his rapid waves, and raised his hoarse mouth from the midst of his fords, and thus he said: \"Why, in sorrow, art thou pacing my banks, Ilia, the descendant of Laomedon [584] of Ida? Whither have gone thy vestments? Why wandering thus alone? And why does no white fillet [585] bind thy hair tied up? Why weepest thou, and why spoil thy eyes wet with tears? And why beat thy open breast with frenzied hand? That man has both flints and ore of iron in his breast, who, unconcerned, beholds the tears on thy delicate face. Ilia, lay aside thy fears; my palace shall be opened unto thee; the streams, too, shall obey thee; Ilia, lay aside thy fears. Among a hundred Nymphs or more, thou shalt hold the sway; for a hundred or more does my stream contain. Only, descendant of Troy, despise me not, I pray; gifts more abundant than my promises shalt thou receive.\" _Thus_ he said; she casting on the ground her modest eyes, as she wept, besprinkled her warm breast with her tears. Thrice did she attempt to fly; thrice did she stop short at the deep waves, as fear deprived her of the power of running. Still, at last, as with hostile fingers she tore her hair, with quivering lips she uttered these bitter words; \"Oh! would that my bones had been gathered up, and hidden in the tomb of my fathers, while yet they could be gathered, belonging to me a virgin! Why now, am I courted [586] for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be driven from the altars of Ilium? Why do I hesitate? See! by the fingers of the multitude am I pointed at as unchaste.

The flowing stream is said to have placed his hands beneath her breast, and to have conferred on her the privilege of his nuptial couch. 'Tis worthy of belief, too, that thou hast been inflamed _with love_ for some maiden; but the groves and woods conceal thy failings. While I have been talking, it has become more swollen with its extending waves, and the deep channel contains not the rushing waters. What, furious torrent, hast thou against me? Why thus delay our mutual transports? Why, churlish river, interrupt the journey once commenced? What if thou didst flow according to some fixed rule, [588] a river of some note? What if thy fame was mighty throughout the earth? But no name hast thou collected from the exhausted rivulets; thou hast no springs, no certain abode hast thou. In place of spring, thou hast rain and melted snow; resources which the sluggish winter supplies to thee. Either in muddy guise, in winter time, thou dost speed onward in thy course; or filled with dust, thou dost pass over the parched ground. What thirsty traveller has been able to drink of thee then? Who has said, with grateful lips, \"Mayst thou flow on for ever?\" _Onward_ thou dost run, injurious to the flocks, [589] still more injurious to the fields. Perhaps these _mischiefs may move_ others; my own evils move me. And, oh shocking! did I in my madness relate to this stream the loves of the rivers? I am ashamed unworthily to have pronounced names so great. Gazing on I know not what, could I speak of the rivers [590] Acheloüs and Inachus, and could I, Nile, talk of thy name? But for thy deserts, torrent far from clear, I wish that for thee there may be scorching heat, and winter always dry.

ELEGY VIII. _He laments that he is not received by his mistress, and complains that she gives the preference to a wealthy rival._ |And does any one still venerate the liberal arts, or suppose that soft verses have any merit? Genius once was more precious than gold; but now, to be possessed of nought is the height of ignorance. After my poems [591] have proved very pleasing to my mistress, it is not allowed me to go where it has been allowed my books. When she has much bepraised me, her door is shut on him who is praised; talented _though I be_, I disgracefully wander up and down. Behold! a Knight gorged with blood, lately enriched, his wealth acquired [592] through his wounds, [593] is preferred before myself. And can you, my life, enfold him in your charming arms? Can you, my life, rush into his embrace? If you know it not, that head used to wear a helmet; that side which is so at your service, was girded with a sword. That left hand, which thus late [594] the golden ring so badly suits, used to bear the shield; touch his right, it has been stained with blood. And can you touch that right hand, by which some person has met his death? Alas! where is that tenderness of heart of yours? Look at his scars, the traces of his former fights; whatever he possesses, by that body was it acquired. [595] Perhaps, too, he will tell how often he has stabbed a man; covetous one, will you touch the hand that confesses this? I, unstained, the priest of the Muses and of Phoebus, am he who is singing his bootless song before your obdurate doors. Learn, you who are wise, not what we idlers know, but how to follow the anxious troops, and the ruthless camp; instead of good verses hold sway over [596] the first rank; through this, Homer, hadst thou wished it, she might have proved kind to thee. Jupiter, well aware that nothing is more potent than gold, was himself the reward of the ravished damsel.

To the shades below had he removed brass and silver, and, together with gold, the weight of iron; and no ingots were there _in those times_. But she used to give what was better, corn without the crooked plough-share, apples too, and honey found in the hollow oak. And no one used with sturdy plough to cleave the soil; with no boundaries [599] did the surveyor mark out the ground. The oars dipped down did not skim the upturned waves; then was the shore [601] the limit of the paths of men. Human nature, against thyself hast thou been so clever; and for thy own destruction too ingenious. To what purpose surround cities with turreted fortifications? [602] To what purpose turn hostile hands to arms? What hast thou to do with the sea? With the earth thou mightst have been content. Why not seek the heavens [603] as well, for a third realm? To the heavens, too, dost thou aspire, so far as thou mayst. Quirinus, Liber, and Alcides, and Caesar but recently, [604] have their temples. Instead of corn, we dig the solid gold from the earth; the soldier possesses riches acquired by blood. To the poor is the Senate-house [605] shut; wealth alone confers honours; [606] hence, the judge so grave; hence the knight so proud. Let them possess it all; let the field of Mars [607] and the Forum [608] obey them; let these administer peace and cruel warfare. Only, in their greediness, let them not tear away my mistress; and 'tis enough, so they but allow something to belong to the poor. But now-a-days, he that is able to give away plenty, rules it _over a woman_ like a slave, even should she equal the prudish Sabine dames. The keeper is in my way; with regard to me, [609] she dreads her husband. If I were to make presents, both of them would entirely disappear from the house. Oh! if any God is the avenger of the neglected lover, may he change riches, so ill-gotten, into dust. ELEGY IX. _He laments the death of the Poet Tibullus._ |If his mother has lamented Memnon, his mother Achilles, and if sad deaths influence the great Goddesses; plaintive Elegy, unbind thy sorrowing tresses; alas! too nearly will thy name be derived from fact! The Poet of thy own inspiration, [610] Tibullus, thy glory, is burning, a lifeless body, on the erected pile. [611] Lo! the son of Venus bears both his quiver inverted, and his bow broken, and his torch without a flame; behold how wretched with drooping wings he goes: and how he beats his naked breast with cruel hand. His locks dishevelled about his neck receive his tears, and his mouth resounds with sobs that convulse his body. 'Twas thus, beauteous Iulus, they say that thou didst go forth from thy abode, at the funeral of his brother Æneas. Not less was Venus afflicted when Tibullus died, than when the cruel boar [612] tore the groin of the youth. And yet we Poets are called 'hallowed,' and the care of the Deities; there are some, too, who believe that we possess inspiration. [613] Inexorable Death, forsooth, profanes all that is hallowed; upon all she lays her [614] dusky hands. What availed his father, what, his mother, for Ismarian Orpheus [615] What, with his songs to have lulled the astounded wild beasts? The same father is said, in the lofty woods, to have sung 'Linus! Alas! Linus! Alas! [616] to his reluctant lyre. Add the son of Mæon, [617] too, by whom, as though an everlasting stream, the mouths of the poets are refreshed by the waters of Piëria: him, too, has his last day overwhelmed in black Avernus; his verse alone escapes the all-consuming pile. The fame of the Trojan toils, the work of the Poets is lasting, and the slow web woven [618] again through the stratagem of the night. So shall Nemesis, so Delia, [619] have a lasting name; the one, his recent choice, the other his first love. What does sacrifice avail thee? [620] Of what use are now the 'sistra' of Egypt? What, lying apart [621] in a forsaken bed? When the cruel Destinies snatch away the good, (pardon the confession) I am tempted to think that there are no Deities. Live piously; pious _though you be_, you shall die; attend the sacred worship; _still_ ruthless Death shall drag the worshipper from the temples to the yawning tomb. [622] Put your trust in the excellence of your verse; see! Tibullus lies prostrate; of so much, there hardly remains _enough_ for a little urn to receive. And, hallowed Poet, have the flames of the pile consumed thee, and have they not been afraid to feed upon that heart of thine?

They could have burned the golden temples of the holy Gods, that have dared a crime so great. She turned away her face, who holds the towers of Eryx; [623] there are some, too, who affirm that she did not withhold her tears. But still, this is better than if the Phæacian land [624] had buried him a stranger, in an ignoble spot. Here, [625] at least, a mother pressed his tearful eyes [626] as he fled, and presented the last gifts [627] to his ashes; here a sister came to share the grief with her wretched mother, tearing her unadorned locks. And with thy relatives, both Nemesis and thy first love [628] joined their kisses; and they left not the pile in solitude. Delia, as she departed, said, \"More fortunately was I beloved by thee; so long as I was thy flame, thou didst live.\" To her said Nemesis: \"What dost thou say? Are my sufferings a pain to thee? When dying, he grasped me with his failing hand.\" [629] If, however, aught of us remains, but name and spirit, Tibullus will exist in the Elysian vales. Go to meet him, learned Catullus, [630] with thy Calvus, having thy youthful temples bound with ivy. Thou too, Gallus, (if the accusation of the injury of thy friend is false) prodigal of thy blood [631] and of thy life. Of these, thy shade is the companion; if only there is any shade of the body, polished Tibullus; thou hast swelled the blessed throng. Rest, bones, I pray, in quiet, in the untouched urn; and may the earth prove not heavy for thy ashes. ELEGY X. _He complains to Ceres that during her rites he is separated from his mistress._ |The yearly season of the rites of Ceres [632] is come: my mistress lies apart on a solitary couch. Yellow Ceres, having thy floating locks crowned with ears of corn, why dost thou interfere with my pleasures by thy rites? Thee, Goddess, nations speak of as bounteous everywhere: and no one is less unfavorable to the blessings of mankind. In former times the uncouth peasants did not parch the corn; and the threshing floor was a name unknown on earth. But the oaks, the early oracles, [633] used to bear acorns; these, and the grass of the shooting sod, were the food of men. Ceres was the first to teach the seed to swell in the fields, and with the sickle did she cut her coloured locks; she first forced the bulls to place their necks beneath the yoke; and she with crooked tooth turned up the fallow ground. Can any one believe that she takes delight in the tears of lovers, and is duly propitiated with misery and single-blessedness? Nor yet (although she loves the fruitful fields) is she a coy one; nor lias she a breast devoid of love. The Cretans shall be my witnesses; and the Cretans do not feign everything; the Cretans, a nation proud of having nurtured Jove. [634] There, he who rules the starry citadel of the world, a little child, drank milk with tender lips. There is full confidence in the witness; by its foster-child the witness is recommended I think that Ceres will confess her frailties, so well known. The Goddess had beheld Iasius [635] at the foot of Cretan Ida, as he pierced the backs of the wild beasts with unerring hand. She beheld, and when her tender marrow caught the flame; on the one side Shame, on the other Love, inflamed her. Shame was conquered by Love; you might see the furrows lying dry, and the crops coming up with a very small proportion of their wheat. [636] When the mattocks stoutly wielded had turned up the land, and the crooked plough had broken the hard earth, and the seed had fallen equally scattered over the wide fields; the hopes of the deceived husbandman were vain. The Goddess, the guardian of corn, was lingering in the lofty woods; the wreaths of com had fallen from her flowing locks. Crete alone was fertile in its fruitful year; all places, whither the Goddess had betaken herself, were one continued harvest. Ida, the locality itself for groves, grew white with corn, and the wild boar cropped the ears in the woods. The law-giving Minos [637] wished for himself many like years; he wished that the love of Ceres might prove lasting. Whereas, yellow-haired Goddess, single-blessedness would have been sad to thee; this am I now compelled by thy rites to endure.

These gifts is it fitting to bear to the ruling Gods. ELEGY XI. _He tells his mistress that he cannot help loving her._ |Much and long time have I suffered; by your faults is my patience overcome. Depart from my wearied breast, disgraceful Love. In truth I have now liberated myself, and I have burst my chains; and I am ashamed to have borne what it shamed me not to endure. I have conquered; and Love subdued I have trodden under foot; late have the horns [638] come upon my head. Have patience, and endure, [639] this pain will one day avail thee; often has the bitter potion given refreshment to the sick. And could I then endure, repulsed so oft from thy doors, to lay a free-born body upon the hard ground? [640] And did I then, like a slave, keep watch before thy street door, for some stranger I know not whom, that you were holding in your embrace? And did I behold it, when the wearied paramour came out of your door, carrying off his jaded and exhausted sides? Still, this is more endurable than the fact that I was beheld by him; [641] may that disgrace be the lot of my foes. When have I not kept close fastened to your side as you walked, [642] myself your keeper, myself your husband, myself your companion? And, celebrated by me forsooth, did you please the public: my passion was the cause of passion in many. Why mention the base perjuries of your perfidious tongue? and why the Gods forsworn [643] for my destruction? Why the silent nods of young men at banquets, [644] and words concealed in signs arranged _beforehand?_ She was reported to me to be ill; headlong and distracted I ran; I arrived; and, to my rival she was not ill. [645] Bearing these things, and others on which I am silent, I have oft endured them; find another in my stead, who could put up with these things. Now my ship, crowned with the votive chaplet, listens in safety to the swelling waves of the ocean. Cease to lavish your blandishments and the words which once availed; I am not a fool, as once I was. Love on this side, Hatred on that, are struggling, and are dragging my tender heart in opposite directions; but Love, I think, still gets the better. I will hate, [646] if I can; if not, reluctantly will I love; the bull loves not his yoke; still, that which he hates he bears. I fly from treachery; your beauty, as I fly, brings me back; I abhor the failings of your morals; your person I love. Thus, I can neither live without you, nor yet with you; and I appear to be unacquainted with my own wishes. I wish that either you were less handsome, or less unprincipled. So beauteous a form does not suit morals so bad. Your actions excite hatred; your beauty demands love. Ah wretched me! she is more potent than her frailties. O pardon me, by the common rites of our bed, by all the Gods who so often allow themselves to be deceived by you, and by your beauty, equal to a great Divinity with me, and by your eyes, which have captivated my own; whatever you shall be, ever shall you be mine; only do you make choice whether you will wish me to wish as well to love you, or whether I am to love you by compulsion. I would rather spread my sails and use propitious gales; since, though I should refuse, I shall still be forced to love. ELEGY XII. _He complains that he has rendered his mistress so celebrated by his verses, as to have thereby raised for himself many rivals._ |What day was that, on which, ye birds of no white hue, you sent forth your ominous notes, ever sad to me in my loves? Or what star must I consider to be the enemy of my destiny? Or what Deities am I to complain of, as waging war against me? She, who but lately [647] was called my own, whom I commenced alone to love, I fear that with many she must be shared by me. Am I mistaken? Or has she gained fame by my poems? 'Tis so; by my genius has she been made public. And justly; for why have I made proclamation [648] of her charms? Through my fault has the fair been put up for sale. She pleases, and I the procurer; by my guidance is the lover introduced; by my hands has her door been opened. Whether verses are of any use, is matter of doubt; at all events, they have injured me; they have been envious of my happiness. While Thebes, [649] while Troy, while the exploits of Caesar existed; Corinna alone warmed my genius. Would that I had meddled with verses against the will of the Muses; and that Phoebus had deserted the work commenced! And yet, it is not the custom to listen to Poets as witnesses; [650] I would have preferred all weight to be wanting to my words.

And yet, it is not the custom to listen to Poets as witnesses; [650] I would have preferred all weight to be wanting to my words. Through us, Scylla, who robbed her father of his white hair, bears the raging dogs [651] beneath her thigh and loins. We have given wings to the feet, serpents to the hair; the victorious descendant of Abas [652] is borne upon the winged steed. We, too, have extended Tityus [653] over the vast space, and have formed the three mouths for the dog bristling -with snakes. We have described Enceladus, [654] hurling with his thousand arms; and the heroes captivated by the voice of the two-shaped damsels. [655] In the Ithacan bags [656] have we enclosed the winds of Æolus; the treacherous Tantalus thirsts in the middle of the stream. Of Niobe we have made the rock, of the damsel, the she-bear; the Cecropian [657] bird sings of Odrysian Itys. Jupiter transforms himself, either into a bird, or into gold [658] or, as a bull, with the virgin placed upon him, he cleaves the waves. Why mention Proteus, and the Theban seed, [659] the teeth? Why that there were bulls, which vomited flames from their mouths? Why, charioteer, that thy sisters distil amber tears? [660] Why that they are now Goddesses of the sea, who once were ships? [661] Why that the light of day fled from the hellish banquet [662] of Atreus? And why that the hard stones followed the lyre [663] as it was struck? The fertile license of the Poets ranges over an immense space; and it ties not its words to the accuracy of history. So, too, ought my mistress to have been deemed to be falsely praised; now is your credulity a mischief to me. ELEGY XIII. _He describes the Festival of Juno, as celebrated at Falisci, the native place of his wife._ As my wife was born at Falisci, so fruitful in apples, we repaired to the walls that were conquered, Camillus, by thee. [664] The priestesses were preparing the chaste festival of Juno, with distinguished games, and the heifer of the country. 'Twas a great remuneration for my stay, to be acquainted with the ceremony; although a path, difficult from the ascent, leads the way thither. There stands a grove, ancient, and shaded with numberless trees; look at it, you must confess that a Divinity exists in the spot. An altar receives the prayers, and the votive incense of the pious; an altar made without skill, by ancient hands. When, from this spot, the pipe has given the signal with its usual note, the yearly procession moves along the covered paths. [665] Snow-white heifers [666] are led, as the crowd applauds, which the Faliscan grass has fed on its own plains; calves, too, not yet threatening with the forehead to inspire fear; and the pig, a smaller victim, from its lowly sty; the leader too, of the flock, with his horns bending back over his hardy temples; the goat alone is odious to the Goddess queen. By her betrayal, discovered in the lofty woods, [667] she is said to have desisted from the flight she had commenced. Even now, by the boys, is she aimed at as a mark; [668] and she is given, as a prize, to the author of her wound. Where the Goddess is to come, the youths and bashful girls sweep the roads before her, with garments [669] as they lie. Their virgin hair is adorned with gold and gems; and the proud mantle conceals their feet, bedecked with gold. After the Grecian manner [670] of their ancestors, clad in white garments, they bear the sacred vessels entrusted to them on their heads, placed beneath. The people hold religious silence, [671] at the moment when the resplendent procession comes up; and she herself follows after her priestesses. Argive is the appearance of the procession; Agamemnon slain, Halesus [672] fled from both his crime and his father's wealth. And now, an exile, having wandered over both land and sea, he erected lofty walls with prospering hand. He taught his own Falisci the rites of Juno. May they be ever propitious to myself, may they be ever so to her own people. ELEGY XIV. _He entreats his mistress, if she will not be constant, at least, to conceal her intrigues from him._ |Beauteous since you are, I do not forbid your being frail; but let it not be a matter of course, that wretched I should know it. Nor does any severity of mine command you to be quite correct; but it only entreats you to try to conceal the truth. She is not culpable, whoever can deny that she has been culpable; and 'tis only the confession of error that makes a woman disgraced.

She is not culpable, whoever can deny that she has been culpable; and 'tis only the confession of error that makes a woman disgraced. What madness is it to confess in light of day what lies concealed in night? And what you do in secret, to say openly that it is done? The strumpet about to entertain some obscure Roman, first keeps out the public by fastening up the bar. And will you make known your frailties to malicious report? And will you make proof of your own criminality? May your mind be more sound, or, at least, may you imitate the chaste; and although you are not, let me suppose that you are chaste. What you do, still do the same; only deny that you do so; and be not ashamed in public to speak the language of chastity. There is the occasion which demands wantonness; sate it with every delight; far thence be all modesty. Soon as you take your departure thence; away at once with all lasciviousness, and leave your frailties in your chamber= ```Illic nec tunicam tibi sit posuisse rubori, ````Nec femori impositum sustinuisse femur: ```Illic purpureis condatur lingua labellis: ````Inque modos Venerem mille figuret amor; ```Illic nec voces, nec verba juvantia cessent; ````Spondaque lascivâ mobilitate tremat.= With your garments put on looks that dread accusation; and let modesty disavow improper pursuits. Deceive the public, deceive me, too; in my ignorance, let me be mistaken, and allow me to enjoy my silly credulity. Why do I so often espy letters sent and received? Why one side and the other [673] tumbled, of your couch? Why do I see your hair disarranged more than happens in sleep, and your neck bearing the marks of teeth? The fading itself alone you do not bring before my eyes; if you hesitate consulting your own reputation, still, spare me. My senses fail me, and I am expiring, oft as you confess your failings; and the drops flow, chilled throughout my limbs. Then do I love you; then, in vain, do I hate what I am forced to love; 673 then I could wish myself to be dead, but together with you. No enquiries, for my part, will I make, nor will I try to know what you shall attempt to conceal; and to me it shall be the same as a false charge. If, however, you shall be found detected in the midst of your guilt, and if criminality shall be beheld by my eyes; what has been plainly seen, do you deny to have been plainly seen; my own eyes shall give way to your assertions.'Tis an easy conquest for you to vanquish me, who desire to be vanquished. Let your tongue only be mindful to say--\"I did not do it!\" since it is your lot to conquer with two words; although not by the merit of your cause, still conquer through your judge. ELEGY X. _He tells Venus that he now ceases to write Elegies._ |Seek a new Poet, mother of the tender Loves; here the extreme turning-place is grazed [674] by my Elegies, which I, a foster-child of the Pelignian fields, have composed; nor have my sportive lays disgraced me. _Me, I say, who_, if that is aught, am the heir to my rank, [675] even through a long line of ancestors, and not lately made a Knight in the hurly-burly of warfare. Mantua delights in Virgil, Verona in Catullus; I shall be called the glory of the Pelignian race; which its own liberties summon to glorious arms, [676] when trembling Rome dreaded [677] the allied bands. And some stranger will say, as he looks on the walls of the watery Sulmo, which occupy but a few acres of land, \"Small as you are, I will call you great, who were able to produce a Poet so great.\" Beauteous boy, and thou, Amathusian parent [678] of the beauteous boy, raise your golden standard from my fields. The horned [679] Lyæus [680] has struck me with a thyrsus more potent; with mighty steeds must a more extended plain be paced. Unwarlike Elegies, my sportive [681] Muse, farewell; a work destined to survive long after I am dead and gone.---- FOOTNOTES BOOK ONE: [Footnote 001: Were five books.--Ver. 1. From this it is clear, that the first edition which Ovid gave to the public of his 'Amores' was in five Books; but that on revising his work, he preferred (praetulit) these three books to the former five. It is supposed that he rejected many of those Elegies which were of too free a nature and were likely to embroil him with the authorities, by reason of their licentiousness.] [Footnote 002: Though it should.--Ver. 3. Burmann has rightly observed, that 'ut jam,' in this line, has exactly the force of 'quamvis,' 'although.'] [Footnote 003: In serious numbers.--Ver. 1. By the 'graves numeri,' he means Heroic or Hexameter verses. It is supposed that he alludes to the battle of the Giants or the Titans, on which subject he had begun to write an heroic poem.

By the 'graves numeri,' he means Heroic or Hexameter verses. It is supposed that he alludes to the battle of the Giants or the Titans, on which subject he had begun to write an heroic poem. In these lines Ovid seems to have had in view the commencement of the first Ode of Anacreon.] [Footnote 004: Suited to the measure.--Ver. 2. The subject being of a grave character, and, as such, suited to Heroic measure.] [Footnote 005: Abstracted one foot.--Ver. 4. He says that every second line (as is the case in Heroic verse) had as many feet as the first, namely, six : but that Cupid stole a foot from the Hexameter, and reduced it to a Pentameter, whereby the Poet was forced to recur to the Elegiac measure.] [Footnote 008: Diminish my energies.--Ver. 18. See the Note to the fourth line.] [Footnote 009: His quiver loosened.--Ver. 21. The 'pharetra,' or quiver, filled with arrows, was used by most of the nations that excelled in archery, among whom were the Scythians, Persians, Lycians, Thracians, and Cretans. It was made of leather, and was sometimes adorned with gold or painting. It had a lid, and was suspended by a belt from the right shoulder. Its usual position was on the left hip, and it was thus worn by the Scythians and Egyptians. The Cretans, however, wore it behind the back, and Diana, in her statues, is represented as so doing. This must have been the method in which Cupid is intended in the present instance to wear it, as he has to unloose the quiver before he takes out the arrow. Some Commentators, however, would have 'solutâ' to refer simply to the act of opening the quiver.] [Footnote 010: In six feet.--Ver. 27. He says that he must henceforth write in Hexameters and Pentameters, or, in other words, in the Elegiac measure.] [Footnote 011: My Muse.--Ver. 30. The Muse addressed by him would be Erato, under whose protection were those Poets whose theme was Love. He bids her wreathe her hair with myrtle, because it was sacred to Venus; while, on the other hand, laurels would be better adapted to the Heroic Muse. The myrtle is said to love the moisture and coolness of the sea-shore.] [Footnote 014: Thy step-father.--Ver. 24. He calls Mars the step-father of Cupid, in consequence of his intrigue with Venus.] [Footnote 015: Birds so yoked.--Ver. 26. These are the doves which were sacred to Venus and Cupid. By yoking them to the chariot of Mars, the Poe wishes to show the skill and power of Cupid.] [Footnote 016: Io triumphe.--Ver. 25. 'Clamare triumphum,' means 'to shout Io triumphe,' as the procession moves along. Lactantius speaks of a poem called 'the Triumph of Cupid,' in which Jupiter and the other Gods were represented as following him in the triumphal procession.] [Footnote 017: Thyself with gold.--Ver. 42. The poet Mosehus represents Cupid as having wings of gold.] [Footnote 018: The Gangetic land.--Ver. 47. He alludes to the Indian triumphs of Bacchus, which extended to the river Ganges.] [Footnote 019: Thy kinsman Cæsar--Ver. 51. Because Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Cæsar, was said to be descended from Venus, through the line of Æneas.] [Footnote 020: Shield the conquered.--Ver. 52. Although Augustus had many faults, it must be admitted that he was, like Julius, a most merciful conqueror, and was generally averse to bloodshed.] [Footnote 021: Founder of my family. --Ver. 8. See the Life of Ovid prefixed to the Fasti; and the Second Book of the Tristia.] [Footnote 022: Each of my parents.--Ver. 10. From this it appears that this Elegy was composed during the life-time of both of his parents, and while, probably, he was still dependent on his father.] [Footnote 023: No rover in affection.--Ver. 15. 'Desuitor,' literally means 'one who leaps off.' The figure is derived from those equestrians who rode upon several horses, or guided several chariots, passing from the one to the other. This sport was very frequently exhibited in the Roman Circus. Among the Romans, the 'desuitor' generally wore a 'pileus,' or cap of felt.

He alludes to Leda and Europa.] [Footnote 026: The same banquet.--Ver. 1. He says that they are about to meet at 'coena,' at the house of a common friend.] [Footnote 027: The last meal.--Ver. 2. The 'coena' of the Romans is usually translated by the word 'supper'; but as being the chief meal of the day, and being in general, (at least during the Augustan age) taken at about three o'clock, it really corresponds to our 'dinner.'] [Footnote 028: Warm the bosom of another.--Ver. 5. As each guest while reclining on the couch at the entertainment, mostly leaned on his left elbow during the meal, and as two or more persons lay on the same couch, the head of one person reached to the breast of him who lay above him, and the lower person was said to lie on the bosom of the other. Among the Romans, the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three. Sometimes, however, four occupied one couch; while, among the Greeks, only two reclined upon it. In this instance, he describes the lady as occupying the place below her husband, and consequently warming his breast with her head. For a considerable time after the fashion of reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the Roman ladies sat at meals while the other sex was recumbent. Indeed, it was generally considered more becoming for females to be seated, especially if it was a party where many persons were present. Juvenal, however, represents a bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the bosom of her husband. On the present occasion, it is not very likely that the ladies were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette. It must be remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken off.] [Footnote 029: Damsel of Atrax.--Ver. 8. He alludes to the marriage of Hippodamia to Pirithous, and the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapithæ, described in the Twelfth-. Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 031: Do come first.--Ver. 14. He hardly knows why he asks her to do so, but still she must come before her husband; perhaps, that he may have the pleasure of gazing upon her without the chance of detection; the more especially as she would not recline till her husband had arrived, and would, till then, probably be seated.] [Footnote 032: Touch my foot.--Ver. 16. This would show that she had safely received his letter.] [Footnote 033: My secret signs.--Ver. 18.

See the 88th line of the 17th Epistle.] [Footnote 036: Your blooming cheeks.--Ver. 22. Probably by way of check to his want of caution.] [Footnote 037: Twisted on your fingers.--Ver. 26. The Sabines were the first to introduce the practice of wearing rings among the Romans. The Romans generally wore one ring, at least, and mostly upon the fourth finger of the left hand. Down to the latest period of the Republic, the rings were mostly of iron, and answered the'purpose of a signet. The right of wearing a gold ring remained for several centuries the exclusive privilege of Senators, Magistrates, and Knights. The emperors were not very scrupulous on whom they conferred the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and Severus and Aurelian gave the right to all Roman soldiers. Vain persons who had the privilege, literally covered their fingers with rings, so much so, that Quintilian thinks it necessary to warn the orator not to have them above the middle joint of the fingers. The rings and the gems set in them, were often of extreme beauty and value. From Juvenal and Martial we learn that the coxcombs of the day had rings for both winter and summer wear. They were kept in 'dactyliothecæ,' or ring boxes, where they were ranged in a row.] [Footnote 038: Who are in prayer.--Ver. 27. It was the custom to hold the altar while the suppliant was praying to the Deities; he here directs her, while she is mentally uttering imprecations against her husband, to fancy that the table is the altar, and to take hold of it accordingly.] [Footnote 039: If you are discreet.--Ver. 29. Sapias' is put for 'si sapias,' 'if you are discreet,' 'if you would act sensibly.'] [Footnote 041: Ask the servant.--Ver. 30. This would be the slave, whose office it was to mix the wine and water to the taste of the guests. He was called [oivôxooç] by the Greeks, 'pincerna' by the Romans.] [Footnote 042: Which you have put down.--Ver. 31.

This, from her position, if she reclined below her husband, she would be almost obliged to do.] [Footnote 045: So close at hand.--Ver. 37. A breach of these injunctions would imply either a very lax state of etiquette at the Reman parties, or, what is more probable, that the present company was not of a very select character.] [Footnote 048: Beneath the cloth.--Ver. 48. 'Vestis' means a covering, or clothing for anything, as for a couch, or for tapestry. Let us charitably suppose it here to mean the table cloth; as the passage will not admit of further examination, and has of necessity been somewhat modified in the translation.] [Footnote 049: The conscious covering.--Ver. 50. The 'pallia,' here mentioned, are clearly the coverlets of the couch which he has before mentioned in the 41st line; and from this it is evident, that during the repast the guests were covered with them.] [Footnote 050: Add wine by stealth.--Ver. 52. To make him fall asleep the sooner] [Footnote 051: 'Twas summer time.--Ver. 1. In all hot climates it is the custom to repose in the middle of the day. This the Spaniards call the 'siesta.'] [Footnote 053: A part of the window.--Ver. 3. On the 'fenestræ,' or windows of the ancients, see the Notes to the Pontic Epistles, Book iii. Ep. iii. 1. 5, and to the Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 752. He means that one leaf of the window was open, and one shut.] [Footnote 054: Corinna.--Ver. 9. In the Fourth Book of the Tristia, Elegy x. 1. GO, he says, 'Corinna, (so called by a fictitious name) the subject of song through the whole city, had imparted a stimulus to my geuius.' It has been supposed by some Commentators, that under this name he meant Julia, either the daughter or the grand-daughter of the emperor Augustus, but there seems really to be no ground for such a belief; indeed, the daughter of Augustus had passed middle age, when Ovid was still in boyhood. It is most probable that Corinna was ouly an ideal personage, existing in the imagination of the Poet; and that he intended the name to apply to his favourite mistress for the time being, as, though he occasionally denies it, still, at other times, he admits that his passion was of the roving kind. There are two females mentioned in history of the name of Coriuna. One was a Theban poetess, who excelled in Lyric composition, and was said to have vanquished Pindar himself in a Lyric contest; while the other was a native of Thespiæ, in Bceotia. 'The former, who was famous for both her personal charms and her mental endowments, is supposed to have suggested the use of the name to Ovid.] [Footnote 055: Clothed in a tunic.--Ver. 9. 'Tunica' was the name of the under-garment with both sexes among the Romans. When the wearer was out of doors, or away from home, it was fastened round the waist with a belt or girdle, but when at home and wishing to be entirely at ease, it was, as in the present instance, loose or ungirded. Both sexes usually wore two tunics. In female dress, Varro seems to call the outer tunic 'subucula,' and the 'interior tunica' by the name also of 'indusium.' The outer tunic was also called 'stola,' and, with the 'palla' completed the female dress. The 'tunica interior,' or what is here called tunica,' was a simple shift, and in early times had no sleeves. According to Nonius, it fitted loosely on the body, and was not girded when the 'stola' or outer tunic was put on. Poor people, who could not afford to purchase a 'toga,' wore the tunic alone; whence we find the lower classes called by the name of 'tunicati.'] [Footnote 056: Her flowing hair.--Ver. 10. 'Dividuis,' here means, that her hair was scattered, flowing over her shoulders and not arranged on the head in a knot.] [Footnote 057: Semiramis.--Ver. 11.

Semiramis was the wife of Ninus, king of Babylon, and was famous for her extreme beauty, and the talent which she displayed as a ruler. She was also as unscrupulous in her morals as the fair one whom the Poet is now describing.] [Footnote 058: And Lais.--Ver. 12. There are generally supposed to have beén two famous courtesans of the name of Lais. The first was carried captive, when a child, from Sicily, in the second year of the 91st Olympiad, and being taken to Corinth, became famous throughout Greece for her extreme beauty, and the high price she put upon her favours. Many of the richest and most learned men resorted to her, and became smitten by her charms. The second Lais was the daughter of Alcibiades, by his mistress, Timandra. When Demosthenes applied for a share of her favours, she made the extravagant demand of ten thousand drachmae, upon which, regaining his wisdom (which had certainly forsaken him for a time) he said that he would not purchase repentance at so high a price.] [Footnote 059: In its thinness.--Ver. 13. Possibly it was made of Coan cloth, if Corinna was as extravagant as she was vicious.] [Footnote 060: The cruel fetter--Ver. 1. Among the Romans, the porter was frequently bound by a chain to his post, that he might not forsake it.] [Footnote 062: Watches of the keepers.--Ver. 7. Properly, the 'excubiæ' were the military watches that were kept on guard, either by night or day, while the term 'vigiliæ,' was only applied to the watch by night. He here alludes to the watch kept by jealous men over their wives.] [Footnote 063: Spectres that flit by night.--Ver. 13. The dread of the ghosts of the departed entered largely among the Roman superstitions. See an account of the Ceremony, in the Fifth Book of the Fasti, 1. 422, et seq., for driving the ghosts, or Lemures, from the house.] [Footnote 064: Ready for the whip--Ver. 19. See the Note to the 81st line of the Epistle of De'ianira to Hercules. Ovid says, that he has often pleaded for him to his mistress; indeed, the Roman ladies often showed more cruelty to the slaves, both male and female, than the men did to the male slaves.] [Footnote 065: As you wish.--Ver. 28. Of course it would be the porter's wish that the night should pass quickly on, as he would be relieved in the morning, and was probably forbidden to sleep during the night.] [Footnote 066: Hours of the night pass on.--Ver. 24. This is an intercalary line, being repeated after each seventh one.] [Footnote 067: From the door-post.--Ver. 24. The fastenings of the Roman doors consisted of a bolt placed at the bottom of eacn 'foris,' or wing of the door, which fell into a socket made in the sill. By way of additional precaution, at night, the front door was secured by a bar of wood or iron, here called 'sera,' which ran across, and was inserted in sockets on each side of the doorway. Hence it was necessary to remove or strike away the bar, 'excutere seram,' before the door could be opened.] [Footnote 068: Water of the slave.--Ver. 26. Water was the principal beverage of the Roman slaves, but they were allowed a small quantity of wiue, which was increased on the Saturnalia. 'Far,' or 'spelt,' formed their general sustenance, of which they received one 'libra' daily. Salt and oil were also allowed them, and sometimes fruit, but seldom vegetables. Flesh meat seems not to have been given to them.] [Footnote 069: About my temples.--Ver. 37. 'Circa mea tempora,' literally, 'around my temples' This-expression is used, because it was supposed that the vapours of excessive wine affect the brain. He says that he has only taken a moderate quantity of wine, although the chaplet falling from off his hair would seem to bespeak the contrary.] [Footnote 073: Otherwise I myself!--Ver. 57. Heinsius thinks that this and the following line are spurious.] [Footnote 074: Holding in my torch--Ver. 58. Torches were usually carried by the Romans, for their guidance after sunset, and were generally made of wooden staves or twigs, bound by a rope around them, in a spiral form, or else by circular bands at equal distances. The inside of the torch was filled with flax, tow, or dead vegetable matter, impregnated with pitch, wax, rosin, oil, or other inflammable substances.] [Footnote 075: Love and wine.--Ver. 59. He seems, by this, to admit that he has taken more than a moderate quantity of wine, 'modicum vinum,' as he says above.] [Footnote 076: Anxieties of the prison.--Ver. 64. He alludes to the 'ergastulum,' or prison for slaves, that was attached to most of the Roman farms, whither the refractory slaves were sent from the City to work in chains. It was mostly under ground, and, was lighted with narrow windows, too high from the ground to be touched with the hand", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-83b39f09bb068668fc5d13770de07db5", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "moderate quantity of wine, 'modicum vinum,' as he says above.] [Footnote 076: Anxieties of the prison.--Ver. 64. He alludes to the 'ergastulum,' or prison for slaves, that was attached to most of the Roman farms, whither the refractory slaves were sent from the City to work in chains. It was mostly under ground, and, was lighted with narrow windows, too high from the ground to be touched with the hand. Slaves who had displeased their masters were usually sent there for a punishment, and those of uncouth habits were kept there. Plutarch says that they were established, on the conquest of Italy, in consequence of the number of foreign slaves imported for the cultivation of the conquered territory. They were finally abolished by the Emperor Hadrian.] [Footnote 077: Bird is arousing.--Ver. 66. The cock, whom the poets universally consider as 'the harbinger of morn.'] [Footnote 078: Equally slaves.--Ver. 74. He called the doors, which were bivalve or folding-doors, his 'conservæ,' or 'fellow' slaves,' from the fact of their being obedient to the will of a slave. Plautuâ, in the Asinaria, act. ii sc. 3, has a similar expression:--'Nolo ego fores, conservas meas a te verberarier.' 'I won't have my door, my fellow-slave, thumped by you.'] [Footnote 080: Did not Ajax too.--Ver. 7. Ajax Telamon, on being refused the arms of Achilles, became mad, and slaughtered a flock of sheep, fancying that they were the sons of Atreus, and his enemy Ulysses. His shield, formed of seven ox hides, is celebrated by Homer.] [Footnote 081: Mystic Goddesses.--Ver. 10. Orestes avenged the death of his father, Agamemnon, by slaying his own mother, Clytemnestra, together with her paramour, Ægistheus. He also attempted to attack the Furies, when they haunted him for the murder of his mother.] [Footnote 082: Daughter of Schceneus.--Ver. 13. Atalanta, the Arcadian, or Mae-nalian, was the daughter of Iasius, and was famous for her skill in the chase. Atalanta, the Boeotian, was the daughter of Schceneus, and was renowned for her swiftness, and for the race in which she was outstripped by Hippomenes. The Poet has here mistaken the one for the other, calling the Arcadian one the daughter of Schoeneus. The story of the Arcadian Atalanta is told in the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, and that of the daughter of Schceneus, at the end of the Tenth Book of the same work.] [Footnote 083: The Cretan damsel.--Ver. 16. Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, when deserted on the island of Naxos or Cea.] [Footnote 084: Cassandra.--Ver. 17. Cassandra being a priestess, would wear the sacred fillets, 'vittse.' She was ravished by Ajax Oileus, in the temple of Minerva.] [Footnote 085: The humblest Roman.--Ver. 29. It was not lawful to strike a freeborn human citizen. See Acts, c. xxii. v. 25. 'And as they hound him with thongs, Paul said unto the Centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemncd?' This privilege does not seem to have extended to Roman women of free birth.] [Footnote 086: Strike a Goddess.--Ver. 32. He alludes to the wound inflicted by Diomedes upon Venus, while protecting her son Æneas.] [Footnote 087: Her hurt cheeks--Ver. 40. He implies by this, to his disgrace which has made her cheeks black and blue by his violence.] [Footnote 089: At the middle.--Ver. 48. He says that he ought to have been satisfied with tearing her tunic down to the waist, where the girdle should have stopped short the rent; whereas, in all probability, he had torn it from the top to the bottom.] [Footnote 090: Her free-born cheeks.--Ver. 50. It was a common practice with many of the Romans, to tear and scratch their Slaves on the least provocation.] [Footnote 091: The Parian mountains.--Ver. 52. The marble of Paros was greatly esteemed for its extreme whiteness. Paros was one of the Cyclades, situate about eighteen miles from the island of Delos.] [Footnote 092: Their proper order. --Ver 68. 'In statione,' was originally a military phrase, signifying 'on guard'; from which It came to be applied to any thing in its place or in proper order.] [Footnote 094: Does she derive.--Ver. 3. He says that her name, 'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.] [Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver. 5.

He says that her name, 'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.] [Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver. 5. He alludes to the charms of Circe and Medea. According to Eustathius, Ææa was a city of Colchis.] [Footnote 096: Turns back to its source.--Ver. 6. This the magicians of ancient times generally professed to do.] [Footnote 097: Spinning wheel.--Ver. 8. 'Rhombus,' means a parallelogram with equal sides, but not having right angles, and hence, from the resemblance, a spinning wheel, or winder. The 'licia' were the cords or thrums of the old warp, or the threads of the old web to which the threads of the new warp were joined. Here, however, the word seems to mean the threads alone. The spinning-wheel was much used in magical incantations, not only among the Romans, but among the people of Northern and Western Europe. It is not improbable that the practice was founded on the so-called threads of destiny, and it was the province of the wizard, or sorceress, by his or her charms, to lengthen or shorten those threads, according as their customers might desire. Indeed, in some parts of Europe, at the present day, charms, in the shape of forms of words, are said to exist, which have power over the human life at any distance from the spot where they are uttered; a kind of superstition which dispenses with the more cumbrous paraphernalia of the spinning-wheel. Some Commentators think that the use of the 'licia' implied that the minds of individuals were to be influenced at the will of the enchanter, in the same way as the old thrums of the warp are caught up and held fast by the new threads; this view, however, seems to dispense with the province of the wheel in the incantation. See the Second Book of the Fasti, 1. 572. The old woman there mentioned as performing the rites of the Goddess, Tacita, among her other proceedings, 'binds the enchantea threads on the dark-coloured spinning-wheel.'] [Footnote 098: Venomous exudation.--Ver. 8. This was the substance called 'hippomanes,' which was said to flow from mares when in a prurient state. Hesiod says, that 'hippomanes' was a herb which produced madness in the horses that ate of it. Pliny, in his Eighth Book, says that it is a poisonous excrescence of the size of a fig, and of a black colour, which grows on the head of the mare, and which the foal at its birth is in the habit of biting off, which, if it neglects to do, it is not allowed by its mother to suck. This fictitious substance was said to be especially used in philtres.] [Footnote 099: Moon was empurpled.--Ver. 12. If such a thing as a fog ever exists in Italy, he may very possibly have seen the moon of a deep red colour.] [Footnote 101: That she, transformed.--Ver. 13. 'Versam,' 'transformed,' seems here to be a preferable reading to 'vivam,' 'alive.' Burmann, however, thinks that the 'striges' were the ghosts of dead sorcerers and wizards, and that the Poet means here, that Dipsas had the power of transforming herself into a 'strix' even while living, and that consequently 'vivam' is the proper reading. The 'strix' was a fabulous bird of the owl kind, which was said to suck the blood of children in the cradle. Seethe Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 141, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 102: A double pupil, too.--Ver. 15. The pupil, or apple of the eye, is that part through which light is conveyed to the optic nerve. Some persons, especially females, were said by the ancients to have a double pupil, which constituted what was called 'the evil eye.' Pliny the Elder says, in his Seventh Book, that 'all women injure by their glances, who have a double pupil.' The grammarian, Haephestion, tells us, in his Fifth Book, that the wife of Candaulcs, king of Lydia, had a double pupil. Heinsius suggests, that this was possibly the case with the Ialysian Telchines, mentioned in the Seventh Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 365, 'whose eyes corrupting all things by the very looking upon them, Jupiter, utterly hating, thrust them beneath the waves of his brother.'] [Footnote 103: And their grandsires.--Ver. 17. One hypercritical Commentator here makes this remark: 'As though it were any more difficult to summon forth from the tomb those who have long been dead, than those who are iust deceased.' He forgot that Ovid had to make up his line, and that 'antiquis proavos atavosque' made three good feet, and two-thirds of another.] [Footnote 105: The twofold doors.--Ver. 20. The doors used by the ancients were mostly bivalve, or folding doors.] [Footnote 106: Mars in opposition.--Ver. 29.

He forgot that Ovid had to make up his line, and that 'antiquis proavos atavosque' made three good feet, and two-thirds of another.] [Footnote 105: The twofold doors.--Ver. 20. The doors used by the ancients were mostly bivalve, or folding doors.] [Footnote 106: Mars in opposition.--Ver. 29. She is dabbling here in astrology, and the adverse and favourable aspects of the stars. We are to suppose that she is the agent of the young man who has seen the damsel, and she is telling her that the rising star of Venus is about to bring her good luck.] [Footnote 107: Makes it his care.--Ver. 32. Burmann thinks that this line, as it stands at present, is not pure Latin; and, indeed, 'curæ habet,' 'makes it his care,' seems a very unusual mode of expression. He suggests another reading--'et, cultæ quod tibi défit, habet,' 'and he possesses that which is wanting for your being well-dressed,' namely, money.] [Footnote 108: The damsel blushed.--Ver. 35. He says that his mistress blusned at the remark of the old hag, that the young man was worthy to be purchased by her, if he had not been the first to make an offer. We must suppose that here the Poet peeped through a chink of the door, as he was on the other side, listening to the discourse; or he may have reasonably guessed that she did so, from the remark made in the same line by the old woman.] [Footnote 109: Your eyes cast down.--Ver. 37. The old woman seems to be advising her to pretend modesty, by looking down on her lap, so as not to give away even a look, until she has seen what is deposited there, and then only to give gracious glances in proportion to her present. It was the custom for the young simpletons who lavished their money on the Roman courtesans, to place their presents in the lap or bosom.] [Footnote 111: Sabine females.--Ver. 39. The Sabines were noted for their domestic virtues. The hag hints, that the chastity of the Sabine women was only the result of their want of good breeding. 'Tatio régnante' seems to point to the good old times, in the same way as our old songsters have it, 'When good king Arthur reigned.' Tatius reigned jointly at Rome with Romulus. See the Fourteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 804.] [Footnote 112: In foreign warfare.--Ver. 41. She says, that they are now in a more civilized state, than when they were fighting just without the walls of Rome; now they are solely engaged in foreign conquests, and Venus reigns in the city of the descendants of her son, Æneas.] [Footnote 113: Dispel these frowns.--Ver. 45. The damsel has, probably, frowned here at her last remark, on which she tells her she must learn to dispense with these frowns, and that when she dispels them, 'excutit,' so many faults which might otherwise prove to her disadvantage, will be well got rid of.] [Footnote 114: Penelope used to try.--Ver. 47. Penelope, in order that she might escape the importunity of the suitors, proposed that they should try to bend the bow of Ulysses, promising her hand to him who should prove successful. The hag, however, says that, with all her pretended chastity, Penelope only wanted to find out who was the most stalwart man among her lovers, in order that she might choose him for a husbaud.] [Footnote 116: Graceful in his mantle.--Ver. 59. The 'palla' was especially worn by musicians. She is supposed to refer to the statue of Apollo, which was erected on the Palatine Hill by Augustus; and her design seems to be, to shew that poetry and riches are not so incompatible as the girl may, from her lover's poverty, be led to imagine.] [Footnote 117: At a price for his person.--Ver. 63. That is to say, some rich slave who has bought his own liberty. As many of the Roman slaves were skilful at various trades and handicrafts, and were probably allowed the profits of their work after certain hours in the day, it would be no uncommon thing for a slave, with his earnings, to purchase his liberty. Some of the slaves practised as physicians, while others followed the occupation of literary men.] [Footnote 118: Rubbed with chalk.--Ver. 64. It was the custom to mark with chalk, 'gypsum,' the feet of such slaves as were newly imported for sale.] [Footnote 119: Busts about the halls.--Ver. 65. Instead of 'quinquatria,' which is evidently a corrupt reading, 'circum atria' has been adopted. She is advising the girl not to be led away by notions of nobility, founded on the number of 'ceræ,' or waxen busts of their ancestors, that adorned the 'atria,' or halls of her admirers. See the Fasti, Book i. line 591, and the Note to the passage; also the Epistle of Laodamia to Protesilaus, line 152.] [Footnote 120: Nay, more, should.--Ver. 67.

'Quin' seems to be a preferable reading to-'quid?'] [Footnote 121: There will be Isis.--Ver. 74. The Roman women celebrated the festival of Isis for several successive days, and during that period they care-fully abstained from the society of men.] [Footnote 127: By your censure.--Ver. 80. When she has offended she is to pretend a counter grievance, so as to outweigh her faults.] [Footnote 128: A deaf hearing.--Ver. 86. Literally, 'deaf Godhead.'] [Footnote 129: A crafty handmaid.--Ver. 87. The comedies of Plautus and Terence show the part which the intriguing slaves and handmaids acted on such occasions.] [Footnote 130: A little of many.--Ver. 89. 'Multos,' as suggested by Heinsius, is preferable to 'multi,' which does not suit the sense.] [Footnote 131: Heap from the gleanings--Ver. 90. 'Stipula' here means 'gleanings.' She says, that each of the servants must ask for a little, and those little sums put together will make a decent amount collected from her lovers. No doubt her meaning is, that the mistress should pocket the presents thus made to the slaves.] [Footnote 132: With a cake.--Ver. 94. The old woman tells how, when she has exhausted all other excuses for getting a present, to have the birth-day cake by her, and to pretend that it is her birth-day; in order that her lover may take the hint, and present her with a gift. The birth-day cake, according to Servius, was made of flour and honey; and being set on tabic before the guests, the person whose birth-day it was, ate the first slice, after which the others partook of it, and wished him happiness and prosperity. Presents, too, were generally made on birth-days.] [Footnote 133: The Sacred Street.\"--Ver. 100. The 'via sacra,' or' Sacred Street, from the old Senate house at Rome towards the Amphitheatre, and up the Capitoline hill. For the sale of all kinds of luxuries, it seems to have had the same rank in Rome that Regent Street holds in London. The procuress tells her, that if her admirer makes no presents, she must turn the conversation to the 'Via Sacra;' of course, asking him such questions as, What is to be bought there? What is the price of such and such a thing? And then she is to say, that she is in want of this or that, but unfortunately she has no money, &c.] [Footnote 134: Conceal your thoughts.--Ver. 103. This expression resembles the famous one attributed to Machiavelli, that 'speech was made for the concealment of the thoughts.'] [Footnote 134: Prove his ruin.--Ver. 103. 'Let your lips utter kind things, but let it be your intention to ruin him outright by your extravagance.'] [Footnote 135: Grant thee both no home--Ver. 113. The 'Lares,' being the household Gods, 'nullos Lares,' implies 'no home.'] [Footnote 136: Everlasting thirst.--Ver. 114. In allusion to her thirsty name; see the Note to the second line.] [Footnote 138: Atticus.--Ver. 2. It is supposed that this Atticus was the same person to whom Ovid addresses the Fourth and Seventh Pontic Epistle in the Second Book. It certainly was not Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who died when the Poet was in his eleventh year.] [Footnote 139: The years which.\"--Ver. 5. The age for serving in the Roman armies, was from the seventeenth up to the forty-sixth year.] [Footnote 140: Of his general.--Ver. 8. He alludes to the four night-watches of the Roman army, which succeeded each other every three hours. Each guard, or watch, consisted of four men, of whom one acted as sentry, while the others were in readiness, in case of alarm.] [Footnote 142: The othert doors.--Ver. 20. From the writings of Terence and Plautus, as well as those of Ovid, we find that the youths of Rome were not very scrupulous about kicking down the door of an obdurate mistress.] [Footnote 143: Thracian Rhesits.--Ver. 23. See the preceding Epistle of Pénélope to Ulysses, and the speech of Ulysses in the Thirteenth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 144: Cease to love.--Ver. 32. It is hard to say whether the word 'Desinat' means 'Let him leave off saying so,' or 'Let him cease to love': perhaps the latter is the preferable mode of rendering it.] [Footnote 146: The raving prophetess.--Ver. 38. 'Mænas' literally means 'a raving female,' from the Greek word paivopai, 'to be mad", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-2cc8c8a5ed910d89548c7358325c25cc", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ".] [Footnote 144: Cease to love.--Ver. 32. It is hard to say whether the word 'Desinat' means 'Let him leave off saying so,' or 'Let him cease to love': perhaps the latter is the preferable mode of rendering it.] [Footnote 146: The raving prophetess.--Ver. 38. 'Mænas' literally means 'a raving female,' from the Greek word paivopai, 'to be mad.' He alludes to Cassandra when inspired with the prophetic spirit.] [Footnote 147: At the forge.--Ver. 39. When he was detected by means of the iron net, as related in the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 148: A lazy inactivity.--Ver. 41. When persons wished to be at ease in their leisure moments at home, they were in the habit of loosening the girdle which fastened the tunic; from this circumstance, the term 'dis-cinctus' is peculiarly applied to a state of indolence.] [Footnote 149: Couch and the shade.--Ver. 42. 'Lectus et umbra' means 'lying in bed and reclining in the shade.' The shade of foliage would have peculiar attractions in the cloudless climate of Italy, especially for persons naturally inclined to be idle.] [Footnote 150: To serve.--Ver. 44. 'Æra merere' has the same meaning as 'stipendum merere,' 'to earn the pay of a soldier,' whence it came to signify 'to sene as a soldier.' The ancient accounts differ materially as to the pay which the Roman soldiers received.] [Footnote 151: The Eurotas.--Ver. 1. The Eurotas was the river which flowed past the walls of Sparta. He is alluding to Helen.] [Footnote 152: Amymone.--Ver. 5. She was one of the Danaides, and was carrying water, when she was attacked by a Satyr, and rescued by Neptune. See the Epistle of Hero to Leander, 1. 131, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 153: Fold in his dress.--Ver. 18. The 'sinhs' of the 'toga,' among the men, and of the 'palla,' among the women, which extended in folds across the breast, was used as a pocket, in which they carried money, purses, letters, and other articles. When the party was seated, the 'sinus' would almost correspond in meaning with our word 'lap.'] [Footnote 154: Avaricious procurer.--Ver. 23. 'Leno' was a person who kept a house for the purposes of prostitution, and who generally robbed his victims of the profits of their unfortunate calling. This was called 'lenocinium,' and the trade was not forbidden, though the 'lenones' were considered 'infames,' or 'disgraced,' and thereby lost certain political rights.] [Footnote 155: By compulsion.--Ver. 24. Being probably the slave of the 'leno,' he would use force to make her comply with his commands.] [Footnote 156: Hired dishonestly.--Ver. 37. The evidence of witnesses was taken by the Praetor, and was called 'jusjurandum in judicio,' whereas the evidence of parties themselves was termed 'jusjurandum in jure.' It was given on oath by such as the Praetor or other judge chose to call, or as either party might propose for examination.] [Footnote 157: The chest.--Ver. 38. The 'area' here means the strong box, or chest, in which the Romans were accustomed to place their money; they were generally made of, or bound with, iron or other metal.] [Footnote 158: Commissioned judge.--Ver. 38. The 'judices selecti' were the 'cen-tumviri,' a body of one hundred and five officers, whose duty it was to assist the Praetor in questions where the right to property was litigated. In the Second Book of the Tristia, 1. 93, we are informed that the Poet himself filled the office of a 'judex selectus.'] [Footnote 159: That is purchased.--Ver. 39. Among the Romans, the 'patroni' defended their 'clientes' gratuitously, and it would have been deemed disgraceful for them to take a fee or present.] [Footnote 160: He who hires.--Ver. 45. The 'conductor' was properly the person who hired the services, or the property of another, for a fixed price. The word sometimes means 'a contractor,' or the person with whom the bargain by the former party is made. See the public contract mentioned in the Fasti, Book v. 1. 293.] [Footnote 161: The Sabine bracelets.--Ver. 49. He alludes to the fate of the Vestal virgin Tarpeia. See the Fasti, Book i. 1. 261, and Note; also the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p. 516.] [Footnote 163: The son pierced.--Ver. 52.

Alcmæon killed his mother Eriphyle, for having betrayed his father Amphiaraus. See the Second Book of the Fasti, 1. 43, and the Third Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. i. 1. 52, and the Notes to the passages.] [Footnote 164: A simple necklace.--Ver. 52. See the Epistle of Deianira to Hercules, and the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses 1. 113, with the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 165: Soil of Alcinoiis.--Ver. 56. The fertile gardens of Alcinoiis, king of the Phæacians, are celebrated by Homer in the Odyssey.] [Footnote 166: The straggling locks.--Ver. 1. The duty of dressing the hair of the Roman ladies was divided among several slaves, who were called by the general terms of 'cosmetæ,' and 'omatrices.' It was the province of one to curl the hair with a hot iron, called 'calamistrum,' which was hollow, and was heated in wood ashes by a slave who, from 'cinis,' 'ashes,' was called 'ciniflo.' The duty of the 'psecas' came next, whose place it was to anoint the hair. Then came that of the 'ornatrix,' who parted the curls with a comb or bodkin; this seems to have been the province of Napè.] [Footnote 167: To be reckoned.--Ver. 2. The Nymphs of the groves were called [Footnote vanâtai ]; and perhaps from them Nape received her name, as it is evidently of Greek origin. One of the dogs of Actæon is called by the same name, in the Metamorphoses, Book iii. 1. 214.] [Footnote 168: Giving the signale.--Ver. 4. 'Notis' may mean here, either 'hints,] 'signs,' 'signals.' or 'letters.' In Nizard's French translation it is rendered 'missives.'] [Footnote 169: Carry these tablets.--Ver. 7. On the wax tablets, see the Note to the Pontic Epistles, Book ii. El. 9.1. 69, and the Metamorphoses, Book ix. 1. 521, with the Note.] [Footnote 170: So well filled.--Ver. 7. 'Peraratas' literally means 'ploughed over'; which term is properly applied to the action of the 'stylus,' in ploughing through the wax upon the tablets. Suetonius relates that Julius Caesar, when he was murdered in the Senate House, pierced the arm af the assassin Cassius with his 'stylus.'] [Footnote 172: A long answer.--Ver. 19. She is to write at once, on having read his letter through. This she could do the more readily, as she could use the same tablets, smoothing the wax with the broad end of the 'graphium,' or 'stylus.'] [Footnote 175: Holding the pen.--Ver. 23. 'Graphium' was the Greek name for the 'stylus,' or pen used for writing on the wax tablets. It was generally of iron or copper, but sometimes of gold. The case in which it was kept was called 'graphiarium,' or 'graphiaria theca.'] [Footnote 176: Of worthless maple.--Ver. 28. He calls the wood of the tablets 'vile,' in comparison with their great services to him: for, according to Pliny, Book xvi. c. 15, maple was the most valued wood for tablets, next to 'citrus,' cedar, or citron wood. It was also more useful than citron, because it could be cut into leaves, or laminae, of a larger size than citron would admit of.] [Footnote 178: Struck her foot.--Ver. 4. This is mentioned as a bad omen by Laodamia, in her Epistle to Protesilaüs, 1. 88. So in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses, in the shocking story of Cinyras and Myrrha; Three times was she recalled by the presage of her foot stumbling.'] [Footnote 180: The Corsican lee.--Ver. 10. From Pliny, Book xvi., we learn that the honey of Corsica was of a bitter taste, in consequence of the box-trees and yews, with which the isle abounded, and which latter, according to him, were poisonous. From Diodorus Siculus we learn that there were many turpentine trees on the island; this would not tend to improve the flavour of the honey.] [Footnote 181: Dyed in vermilion.--Ver. 11. 'Minium,' 'red lead,' or 'vermilion,' was discovered by Callias, an Athenian, according to Theophrastus. It was sometimes mixed with the wax used for tablets: probably not the best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour. This censure of the tablets is a good illustration of the grapes being sour. In the last Elegy, before he has received his repulse, he declares the wax to be 'splen-dida,' 'of brilliaut whiteness through bleaching;' now, on the other hand, he finds, most ominously, that it is as red as blood.] [Footnote 182: Dreadful crosses.--Ver.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5208b8728c96888e457d542e0fba49b2", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour.

See the First Book of the Pontic Epistlea, Ep. vi. 1. 38, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 183: The screech-owl.--Ver. 20. 'Strix' here means a screech-owl; and not the fabulous bird referred to under that name, in the Sixth Book of the Fasti, and the thirteenth line of the Eighth Elegy of this Book.] [Footnote 184: The prosy summons.--Ver. 23. 'Vadimonium legere' probably means, 'to call a man on his bail' or 'recognizances.' When the Praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the defendant to give security for his appearance on the day named. The defendant, on finding a surety, was said 'vades dare,' or 'vadimonium facere': and the 'vas,' or surety, was said 'spondere.' The plaintiff, if satisfied with the surety, was said 'vadari reum,' 'to let the defendant go on his sureties.'] [Footnote 185: Some judge.--Ver. 24. Some Commentators think that the word 'cognitor' here means, the attorney, or procurator of the plaintiff, who might, in his absence, carry on the cause for him. In that case they would translate 'duro,' 'shameless,' or 'impudent.' But another meaning of the word 'cognitor' is 'a judge,' or 'commissioner,' and such seems to be the meaning here, in which case 'duras' will mean 'severe,' or 'sour;' 'as,' according to one Commentator, 'judges are wont to be.' Much better would they lie amid diaries and day-books, [186] over which the avaricious huncks might lament his squandered substance. And have I then in reality as well as in name found you full of duplicity? [187] The very number _of you_ was not one of good omen. What, in my anger, ought I to pray, but that an old age of rottenness may consume you, and that your wax may be white with nasty mould?] [Footnote 186: And day-books.--Ver. 25. Seneca, at the end of his 19th Epistle, calls a Calendar by the name of 'Ephemeris,' while a day-book is meant by the term as used by Ausonius. The word here seems to mean a 'diary;' while 'tabula' is perhaps a 'day-book,' in which current expenses are set down, and over which the miser weeps, as the record of past extravagance.] [Footnote 187: Full of duplicity.--Ver. 27. The word 'duplex' means either 'double,' or 'deceitful,' according to the context. He plays on this twofold meaning, and says that double though they might be, still truly deceitful they were; and that the two leaves of the tablets were of no good omen to him. Two-leaved tablets were technically called 'diptycha.'] [Footnote 189: Honour the shades.--Ver. 4. 'Parento' means 'to celebrate the funeral obsequies of one's parents.' Both the Romans and the Greeks were accustomed to visit the tombs of their relatives at certain times, and to offer sacrifices, called 'inferiæ,' or 'parentalia.' The souls of the departed were regarded by the Romans as Gods, and the oblations to them consisted of milk, wine, victims, or wreaths of flowers. The Poet here refers to the birds which arose from the funeral pile of Memnon, and wera said to revisit it annually. See the Thirteenth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 190: Moisture is cooling.--Ver. 7. 'Humor' seems to mean the dew, or the dampness of the night, which would tend, in a hot climate, to modify the sultriness of the atmosphere. One Commentator thinks that the word means the humours of the brain.] [Footnote 192: To their masters.--Ver. 17. The schools at Rome were mostly kept by manumitted slaves; and we learn from the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 829, that people were not very particular about paying them.] [Footnote 193: The cruel stripes.--Ver. 18. The punishment here mentioned was generally inflicted on the hands of the Roman school-boys, with a 'ferula,' or stalk of giant-fennel, as we learn from Juvenal, Satire 1.] [Footnote 194: The attorney.--Ver. 19.

They were also known by the name of 'juris periti,' or 'consulti' only. Cicero gives this definition of the duty of a 'consultus.'] 'He is à person who has such a knowledge of the laws and customs which prevail in a state, as to be able to advise, and secure a person in his dealings. They advised their clients gratuitously, either in public places, or at their own houses. They also drew up wills and contracts, as in the present instance.] [Footnote 195: To become bail.--Ver. 19. This passage has given much trouble to the Commentators, but it has been well explained by Burmann, whose ideas on the subject are here adopted. The word 'sponsum' has been generally looked upon here as a noun substantive, whereas it is the active supine of the verb 'spondeo,' 'to become bail' or 'security.' The meaning then is, that some rise early, that they may go and become bail for a friend, and thereby incur risk and inconvenience, through uttering a single word, 'spondeo,' 'I become security,' which was the formula used. The obligation was coutracted orally, and for the purpose of evidencing it, witnesses were necessary; for this reason the undertaking was given, as in the present instance, in the presence of a 'jurisconsultus.'] [Footnote 198: To the pleader.--Ver. 21. 'Causidicus' was the person who pleads the cause of his client in court before the Prætor or other judges.] [Footnote 199: What if.--Ver. 33. Heinsius and other Commentators think that this line and the next are spurious. The story of Cephalus and Procris is related at the close of the Seventh Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 201: The Moon gave.--Ver. 43. Ovid says that Diana sent the sleep upon Endymion, whereas it was Jupiter who did so, as a punishment for his passion for Juno; he alludes to the youthfulness of the favorite of Diana, antithetically to the old age of Tithonus, the husband of Aurora.] [Footnote 202: Two nights together.--Ver. 46. When he slept with Acmena, under the form of her husband Amphion.] [Footnote 203: Doctoring your hair.--Ver. 1. Among the ancient Greeks, black hair was the most frequent, but that of a blonde colour was most valued. It was not uncommon with them to dye it when turning grey, so as to make it a black or blonde colour, according to the requirement of the case. Blonde hair was much esteemed by the Romans, and the ladies were in the habit of washing their hair with a composition to make it of this colour. This was called 'spuma caustica,' or, 'caustic soap,' wich was first used by the Gauls and Germans; from its name, it was probably the substance which had been used inthe present instance.] [Footnote 204: So far as ever.--Ver. 4. By this he means as low as her ancles.] [Footnote 205: Afraid to dress.--Ver. 5. He means to say, that it was so fine that she did not dare to curl it, for fear of injuring it.] [Footnote 206: Just like the veils.--Ver. 6. Burmann thinks that 'fila,' 'threads,' is better here than 'vela,' and that it is the correct reading. The swarthy Seres here mentioned, were perhaps the Chinese, who probably began to import their silks into Rome about this period. The mode of producing silk does not seem to have been known to Virgil, who speaks, in the Second Book of the Georgies, of the Seres combing it off the leaves of trees. Pliny also, in his Sixth Book, gives the same account. Ovid, however, seems to refer to silkworms under the name of 'agrestes tineæ,' in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 372.] [Footnote 208: Neither the bodkin.--Ver. 15. This was the 'discerniculum,' a 'bodkin,' which was used in parting the hair.] [Footnote 210: Bid the bodkin.--Ver. 18. The 'acus' here mentioned, was probably the 'discemicirium,' and not the 'crinale,' or hair-pin that was worn in the hair; as the latter was worn when the hair was bound up at the back of the head; whereas, judging from the length of the hair of his mistress, she most probably wore it in ringlets. He says that he never saw her snatch up the bodkin and stick it in the arm of the 'ornatrix.'] [Footnote 211: Iron and the fire.--Ver. 25. He alludes to the unnecessary application of the curling-iron to hair which naturally curled so well.] [Footnote 212: The very locks instruct.--Ver. 30. Because they naturally assume as advantageous an appearance as the bodkin could possibly give them, when arranged with the utmost skill.] [Footnote 213: Dione is painted.--Ver. 34. Pliny, book xxxv. c. 4, mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as rising from the sea.

Pliny, book xxxv. c. 4, mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as rising from the sea. It was placed, by Augustus, in the temple of Julius Caesar; and the lower part having become decayed, no one could be found of sufficient ability to repair it.] [Footnote 214: Lay down the mirror.--Ver. 16. The mirror was usually held by the 'ornatrix,' while her mistress arranged her hair.] [Footnote 215: Herbs of a rival.--Ver. 39. No person would be more likely than the 'pellex,' or concubine, to resort to charms and drugs, for the purpose of destroying the good looks of the married woman whose husband she wishes to retain.] [Footnote 216: All bad omens.--Ver. 41. So superstitious were the Romans, that the very mention of death, or disease, was deemed ominous of ill.] [Footnote 217: Germany will be sending.--Ver 45. Germany having been lately conquered by the arms of Augustus, he says that she must wear false hair, taken from the German captives. It was the custom to cut short the locks of the captives, and the German women were famed for the beauty of their hair.] [Footnote 218: Sygambrian girl.--Ver. 49. The Sygambri were a people of Ger many, living on the banks of the rivers Lippe and Weser.] [Footnote 219: For that spot.--Ver. 53. She carries a lock of the hair, which had fallen off, in her bosom.] [Footnote 221: My tongue for hire.--Ver. 6. Although the 'patronus pleaded the cause of the 'cliens,' without reward, still, by the use of the word 'pros-tituisse,' Ovid implies that the services of the advocate were often sold at a price. It must be remembered, that Ovid had been educated for the Roman bar, which he had left in disgust.] [Footnote 222: Mæonian bard.--Ver. 9. Strabo says, that Homer was a native of Smyrna, which was a city of Maeonia, a province of Phrygia. But Plutarch says, that he was called 'Maeonius,' from Maeon, a king of Lydia, who adopted him as his son.] [Footnote 223: Tenedos and Ida.--Ver. 10. Tenedos, Ida, and Simois, were the scenes of some portions of the Homeric narrative. The first was near Troy, in sight of it, as Virgil says--'est in conspectu Tenedos.'] [Footnote 224: The Ascræan, tool--Ver. 11. Hesiod of Ascræa, in Boeotia, wrote chieflv upon agricultural subjects. See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. ep. xiv. 1. 38.] [Footnote 225: With its juices.--Ver. 11. The 'mustum' was the pure jidcc of the grape before it was boiled down and became 'sapa,' or 'defrutum.' See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 779, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 226: The son of Battus.--Ver. 13. As to the poet Callimachus, the son of Battus, see the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 367, and the Ibis, 1. 55.] [Footnote 227: To the tragic buskin.--Ver. 15. On the 'cothurnus,' or 'buskin,' see the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 393, and the Note to the passage. Sophocles was one of the most famous of the Athenian Tragedians. He is supposed to have composed more than one hundred and twenty tragedies, of which only seven are remaining.] [Footnote 228: Aratus.--Ver. 16. Aratus was a Greek poet, a native of Cilicia, in Asia Minor. He wrote some astronomical poems, of which one, called 'Phænomena,' still exists. His style is condemned by Quintilian, although it is here praised by Ovid. His 'Phænomena' was translated into Latin by Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Sextus Avienus.] [Footnote 229: The deceitful slave.--Ver. 17. Although the plays of Menander have perished, we can judge from Terence and Plautus, how well he depicted the craftiness of the slave, the severity of the father, the dishonesty of the procuress, and the wheedling ways of the courtesan. Four of the plays of Terence are translations from Menander. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 369, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 230: Ennius.--Ver. 19. Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a Calabrian by birth. He flourished about 408 years before Christ. The few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth nature of his style. He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.] [Footnote 231: Accius.--Ver. 19.

Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a Calabrian by birth. He flourished about 408 years before Christ. The few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth nature of his style. He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.] [Footnote 231: Accius.--Ver. 19. See the Second Book of the Tristia, 1. 359, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 232: Of Varro.--Ver. 21. He refers to Publius Terentius Varro Attacinus, who wrote on the Argonautic expedition. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 439, and the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 21.] [Footnote 233: Lucretius.--Ver. 23. Titus Lucretius Carus is referred to, whose noble poem on the Epicurean philosophy is still in existence (translated in Bohn's Classical Library). See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 261 and 426, and the Notes to those passages.] [Footnote 234: Tityrus.--Ver. 25. Under this name he alludes to Virgil, who introduces himself under the name of Tityrus, in his first Eclogue, See the Pontic Epistles, Boek iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 33.] [Footnote 235: So long as thou, Rome.--Ver. 26. His prophecy has been surpassed by the event. Rome is no longer the 'caput urbis,' but the works of Virgil are still read by all civilized nations.] [Footnote 236: Polished Tibullus.--Ver. 28. Albius Tibullus was a Roman poet of Equestrian rank, famous for the beauty of his compositions. He was born in the same year as Ovid, but died at an early age. Ovid mentions him in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 447 and 463, Book iv. Ep. x. 1. 52, and Book v. Ep. i. 1. 18. In the Third Book of the Amores, El. 9, will be found his Lament on the death of Tibullus.] [Footnote 237: Gallus --Ver. 29. Cornelius Gallus was a Roman poet of considerable merit. See the Tristia, Book ii 1. 445, and the Note to the passage, and the Amores, Book iii. El. 1.] [Footnote 238: By the East.--Ver. 29. Gallus was the Roman governor of Egypt, which was an Eastern province of Rome.] [Footnote 239: The golden Tagus.--Ver. 34. Pliny and other authors make mention of the golden sands of the Tagus, which flowed through the province of Lusitania, now Portugal.] [Footnote 240: The closing fire.--Ver. 41. Pliny says that the ancient Romans buried the dead; but in consequence of the bones being disturbed by continual warfare, they adopted the system of burning them.] FOOTNOTES BOOK TWO: [Footnote 301: The watery Peligni.--Ver. 1. In the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1. 81, and the Fourth Book of the Tristia, 1. x. El. 3, he mentions Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, as the place of his birth. It was noted for its many streams or rivulets.] [Footnote 302: And Gyges.--Ver. 12. This giant was more generally called Gyas. He and his hundred-handed brothers, Briareus and Cæus, were the sons of Coelus and Terra.] [Footnote 303: Verses bring down.--Ver. 23. He alludes to the power of magic spells, and attributes their efficacy to their being couched in poetic measures; from which circumstance they received the name of 'carmina.'] [Footnote 304: And by verses.--Ver. 28. He means to say that in the same manner as magic spells have brought down the moon, arrested the sun, and turned back rivers towards their source, so have his Elegiac strains been as wonderfully successful in softening the obduracy of his mistress.] [Footnote 305: Bagous.--Ver. 1. The name Bagoas, or, as it is here Latinized. Bagous, is said to have signified, in the Persian language, 'an eunuch.' It was probably of Chaldæan origin, having that meaning. As among the Eastern nations of the present day, the more jealous of the Romans confided the care of their wives or mistresses to eunuch slaves, who were purchased at a very large price.] [Footnote 306: Daughters of Danaus.--Ver. 4. The portico under the temple of Apollo, on the Palatine Hill, was adorned with the statues of Danaus, the son of Belus, and his forty-nine guilty daughters. It was built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace. Ovid mentions these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1. 10.] [Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver. 20. 'Eat' seems here to mean 'let him go away' from the house; but Nisard's translation renders it 'qu'il entre,' 'let him come in.'] [", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bfdf9595877dab30524e561a06dbcca6", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ", and his forty-nine guilty daughters. It was built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace. Ovid mentions these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1. 10.] [Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver. 20. 'Eat' seems here to mean 'let him go away' from the house; but Nisard's translation renders it 'qu'il entre,' 'let him come in.'] [Footnote 308: At the sacrifice.--Ver. 23. It is hard to say what 'si faciet tarde' means: it perhaps applies to the rites of Isis, mentioned in the 25th line.] If she shall be slow in her sacrifice.'] [Footnote 309: Linen-clad Isis.--Ver. 25. Seethe 74th line of the Eighth Elegy of the preceding Book, and the Note to the passage; and the Pontic Epistles, Book i. line 51, and the Note. The temple of Isis, at Rome, was in the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars, near the sheep market. It was noted for the intrigues and assignations of which it was the scene.] [Footnote 310: He turns the house.--Ver. 29. As the Delphin Editor says, 'Il peut renverser la maison,' 'he can turn the house upside down.'] [Footnote 311: The masters approve..--Ver. 30. He means to say that the eunuch and his mistress will be able to do just as they please.] [Footnote 312: An executioner.--Ver. 36. To blind the husband, by pretending harshness on the part of Bagous.] [Footnote 313: Of the truth.--Ver. 38 This line is corrupt, and there are about ten various readings. The meaning, however, is clear; he is, by making false charges, to lead the husband away from a suspicion of the truth; and to put him, as we say, in common parlance, on the wrong scent.] [Footnote 314: Your limited savings.--Ver. 39. 'Peculium,' here means the stock of money which a slave, with the consent of his master, laid up for his own, 'his savings.' The slaves of the Romans being not only employed in domestic offices and the labours of the field, but as agents or factors for their masters, in the management of business, and as mechanics and artisans in various trades, great profits were made through them. As they were often entrusted with a large amount of property, and considerable temptations were presented to their honesty, it became the practice to allow the slave to consider a part of his gains, perhaps a per centage, as his own; this was termed his 'peculium.' According to the strict letter of the law, the 'peculium' was the property of the master, but, by usage, it was looked upon as the property of the slave. It was sometimes agreed upon between the master and slave, that the latter should purchase his liberty with his 'peculium,' when it amounted to a certain sum. If the slave was manumitted by the owner in his lifetime, his 'peculium' was considered to be given him, with his liberty, unless it was expressly retained.] [Footnote 315: Necks of informers.--Ver. 41. He probably alludes to informers who have given false evidence. He warns Bagous of their fate, intending to imply that both his mistress and himself will deny all, if he should attempt to criminate them.] [Footnote 325: Tongue caused this.--Ver. 44. According to one account, his punishment was inflicted for revealing the secrets of the Gods.] [Footnote 326: Appointed by Juno.--Ver. 45. This was Argus, whose fate is related at the end of the First Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 327: Alas! that.--Ver. 1. He is again addressing Bagous, and begins in a strain of sympathy, since his last letter has proved of no avail with the obdurate eunuch.] [Footnote 328: Mutilate Joys --Ver. 3. According to most accounts, Semiramis was the first who put in practice this abominable custom.] [Footnote 329: Standard be borne.--Ver. 10. He means, that he is bound, with his mistress to follow the standard of Cupid, and not of Mars.] [Footnote 330: Favours to advantage.--Ver. 13. 'Ponere' here means, literally, 'to put out at interest.' He tells the eunuch that he has now the opportunity of conferring obligations, which will bring him in à good interest by way of return.] [Footnote 332: Sabine dames.--Ver. 15. Juvenal, in his Tenth Satire, 1. 293, mentions the Sabine women as examples of prudence and chastity.] [Footnote 333: In her stateliness.--Ver. 16. Burmann would have 'ex alto' to mean 'ex alto pectore,' 'from the depths of her breast.'

Perhaps 'flectere vocem' means what we technically call, in the musical art, 'to quaver.'] [Footnote 335: Her arms to time.--Ver. 29. Dancing was, in general, discouraged among the Romans. That here referred to was probably the pantomimic dance, in which, while all parts of the body were called into action, the gestures of the arms and hands were especially used, whence the expressions 'manus loquacissimi,' 'digiti clamosi,' 'expressive hands,' or 'fingers.' During the Republic, and the earlier periods of the Empire, women never appeared on the stage, but they frequently acted at the parties of the great. As it was deemed disgraceful for a free man to dance, the practice at Rome was probably confined to slaves, and the lowest class of the citizens. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 536, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 336: Hippolytus.--Ver. 32. Hippolytus was an example of chastity, while Priapus was the very ideal of lustfulness.] [Footnote 337: Heroines of old.--Ver. 33. He supposes the women of the Heroic ages to have been of extremely tall stature. Andromache was remarkable for her height.] [Footnote 338: The brunette.--Ver. 39. 'Flava,' when coupled with a female name, generally signifies 'having the hair of a flaxen,' or 'golden colour'; here, however, it seems to allude to the complexion, though it would be difficult to say what tint is meant. Perhaps an American would have no difficulty in translating it 'a yellow girl.' In the 43rd line, he makes reference to the hair of a 'flaxen,' or 'golden colour.'] [Footnote 339: Tablets rubbed out.--Ver. 5. If 'deletæ' is the correct reading here, it must mean 'no tablets from which in a hurry you 'have rubbed off the writing.' 'Non interceptæ' has been suggested, and it would certainly better suit the sense. 'No intercepted tablets have, &c.'] [Footnote 342: The wine on table.--Ver. 14. The wine was probably on this occasion placed on the table, after the 'coena,' or dinner. The Poet, his mistress, and his acquaintance, were, probably, reclining on their respective couches; he probably, pretended to fall asleep to watch, their conduct, which may have previously excited his suspicions.] [Footnote 343: Moving your eyebrows.--Ver. 15. See the Note to the 19th line of the Fourth Elegy of the preceding Book.] [Footnote 344: Were not silent.--Ver. 17. See the Note to the 20th line of the same Elegy.] [Footnote 345: Traced over with wine.--Ver. 18. See the 22nd and 26th lines of the same Elegy.] [Footnote 346: Your discourse.--Ver. 19. He seems to mean that they were pretending to be talking on a different subject from that about which they were really discoursing, but that he understood their hidden meaning. See a similar instance mentioned in the Epistle of Paris to Helen, 1. 241.] [Footnote 347: Hand of a master.--Ver. 30. He asserts the same right over her favours, that the master (dominus) does over the services of the slave.] [Footnote 348: New-made husband.--Ter. 36. Perhaps this refers to the moment of taking off the bridal veil, or 'flammeum,' when she has entered her husband's house.] [Footnote 349: Of her steeds.--Ver. 38. When the moon appeared red, probably through a fog, it was supposed that she was being subjected to the spells of witches and enchanters.] [Footnote 350: Assyrian ivory.--Ver. 40. As Assyria adjoined India, the word 'Assyrium' is here used by poetical licence, as really meaning 'Indian.'] [Footnote 351: Woman has stained.--Ver. 40. From this we learn that it was the custom of the Lydians to tint ivory of a pink colour, that it might not turn yellow with age.] [Footnote 352: Of this quality.--Ver. 54. 'Nota,' here mentioned, is literally the mark which was put upon the 'amphorae,' or 'cadi,' the 'casks' of the ancients, to denote the kind, age, or quality of the wine. Hence the word figuratively means, as in the present instance, 'sort,' or 'quality.' Our word 'brand' has a similar meaning. The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the 'dolia,' or large vessels, in which they were kept into the 'amphoræ,' which were made of earthenware or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum. On the outside, the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage being denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the vessels were of glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f1cbc70bf76a9f17da10b1c67a4da593", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ",' which were made of earthenware or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum.

For a full account of the ancient wines, see Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities.] [Footnote 353: The imitative bird.--Ver. 1. Statius, in his Second Book, calls the parrot 'Humanæ sollers imitator linguæ,' 'the clever imitator of the human voice.'] [Footnote 354: The long trumpet.--Ver. 6. We learn from Aulus Gellius, that the trumpeters at funerals were called 'siticines.' They headed the funeral procession, playing mournful strains on the long trumpet, 'tuba,' here mentioned. These were probably in addition to the 'tibicines,' or 'pipers,' whose number was limited to ten by Appius Claudius, the Censor. See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 653.] [Footnote 360: Affectionate turtle-dove.--Ver. 12. This turtle-dove and the parrot had been brought up in the same cage together. He probably refers to these birds in the thirty-eighth line of the Epistle of Sappho to Phaon where he mentions the turtle-dove as being black. This Elegy is remarkable for its simplicity and pathetic beauty, and can hardly fail to remind the reader of Cowper's Elegies, on the death of the bullfinch, and that of his pet hare.] [Footnote 361: The Phocian youth.--Ver. 15. He alludes to the friendship of Orestes and Pylades the Phocian, the son of Strophius.] [Footnote 362: So prettily.--Ver. 24. 'Bene' means here, 'prettily,' or 'cleverly,' rather than 'distinctly,' which would be inconsistent with the signification of blæsus.] [Footnote 363: All their battles --Ver. 27. Aristotle, in the Eighth Chapter of the Ninth Book of his History of Animals, describes quails or ortolans, and partridges, as being of quarrelsome habits, and much at war among themselves.] [Footnote 364: The foreboder.--Ver. 34. Festus Avienus, in his Prognostics, mentions the jackdaw as foreboding rain by its chattering.] [Footnote 366: Armed Minerva.--Ver. 35. See the story of the Nymph Coronis, in the Second Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 367: After nine ages.--Ver. 36. Pliny makes the life of the crow to last for a period of three hundred years.] [Footnote 368: Destined numbers.--Ver. 40. 'Numeri' means here, the similar. parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'] [Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver. 45. Hippocrates, in his Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the critical days in a malady. Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the person so doing.] [Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver. 48. It may have said 'Corinna;' but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,' 'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.] [Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver. 49. He kindly imagines a place for the souls of the birds that are blessed.] [Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver. 58. His calling around him, in human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and beautifully imagined.] [Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver. 61. This and the following line are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.] [Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver. 1. 'Ergo' here is very expressive. 'Am I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'] [Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver. 15. Perhaps the only holiday that the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June, when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had rendered an important service. See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 311, et seq.] [Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver. 17. She was the 'ornatrix,' or 'tiring woman' of Corinna. As slaves very often received their names from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate character, and extended downwards to the ancles.] [Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver. 22", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9ba3706ec176b6f1bdc3b92e3affac80", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ", et seq.] [Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver. 17. She was the 'ornatrix,' or 'tiring woman' of Corinna. As slaves very often received their names from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate character, and extended downwards to the ancles.] [Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver. 22. From this we see that the whip was applied to the female slaves, as well as the males.] [Footnote 388: Carpathian ocean..--Ver. 20. See the Metamorphoses, Book xi.] 1. 249, and the Note to this passage.] [Footnote 389: Swarthy Cypassis.--Ver. 22. From this expression, she was probably a native of Egypt or Syria.] [Footnote 390: With his spear.--Ver. 7. He alludes to the cure of Telephus by the aid of the spear of Achilles, which had previously wounded him.] [Footnote 391: Cottages of thatch.--Ver. 18. In the First Book of the Fasti, 1.199, he speaks of the time when 'a little cottage received Quiriuus, the begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded him a scanty couch.' The straw-thatched cottage of Romulus was preserved at Rome for many centuries. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 184, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 392: Off to the fields.--Ver. 19. The 'emeriti,' or veterans of the Roman legions, who had served their full time, received a regular discharge, which was called 'missio,' together with a bounty, either in money, or an allotment of land. Virgil was deprived of his property near Mantua, by the officers of Augustus; and in his first Eclogue, under the name of Tityrus, he relates how he obtained restitution of it on applying to the Emperor.] [Footnote 393: Free from the race.--Ver. 20. Literally, 'the starting place.'] [Footnote 394: Wand of repose--Ver. 22. For an account of the 'rudis,' and the privilege it conferred, see the Tristia, Book, iv, El. 8. 1. 24.] [Footnote 395: Græcinus.--Ver. 1. He addresses three of his Pontic Epistles, namely, the Sixth of the First Book, the Sixth of the Second Book, and the Ninth of the Fourth Book, to his friend Græcinus. In the latter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.] [Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver. 3. 'Inermis,' may be rendered, 'off my guard.'] [Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver. 10. 'Pliaselos' is perhaps here used as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was particularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its name from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.' The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various sizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage. Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant vessels. Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness than for their strength. Juvenal, Sat. xv, 1. 127, speaks of them as being made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of the smallest kind.] [Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23. The Poet was of slender figure.] [Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver. 31. He alludes to the 'lorica,' or cuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.] [Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver. 36. He probably was thinking at this moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T. Haterius, of the Equcstriai order, whose singular end is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, 11. ix c. 12, s. 8, and by Pliny the Elder, B. vii., c. 53.] [Footnote 404: The meeting rocks.--Ver 3. See the 121st line of the Epistle of Medea to Jason, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 405: Tinted pebbles.--Ver. 13. The 'picti lapilli' are probably camelians, which are found on the sea shore, and are of various tints.] [Footnote 406: The recreation.--Ver. 14. 'Mora,' 'delay,' is put here for that which causes the delay. 'That is a pleasure which belongs to the shore.'] [Footnote 407: In what Malea.--Ver. 20. Propertius and Virgil also couple Malea, the dangerous promontory on the South of Laconia, with the Syrtes or quicksands of the Libyan coast.] [Footnote 409: Stars of the fruitful Leda.--Ver. 29. Commentators are divided upon the exact meaning of this line. Some think that it refers to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN0nl8DXcCAPAKQlcQTyLvJe+amd/vNzPvPdFUskmVirqvupd1H0vT0lTS1lplRfTjiGPRl3vevDl/85t5zxEbJaSiiv2gziaisVu3uFs0iuyy/v7++11dEXYfwUttf/J+U7jA390XIz6RvvHk8XmlXZh55mISY7WifR0zXaVWtcxRJDlBeRDYkvBUPqaNAVNQs9AKY9Uf0TBzhz4PNe1QxQRPq3I90gx6w62iapRGtunn5WeO68w0diaOj5/IlYh3KVocZM4qW+JNIzFGe8sDhiop/mS+XP8desXOctdoQtLfwv/ht6rNXhE/7jUdlzJddUVZpv6sVfiTUmLB3ytPc8fddcYwlyHwTB0pF56UZkQLvYWhO+C90GTnG0o1M1f5GG7F32tOJhesYo4qxVovOBK1ks36NX9Mj53aKdUvbcaXfKmWSvfw7kanYYszYKyC0/yJUAAuA3saSJ62tfQRDBrlVO/wQbiQranIIi/gFqUrXyTUu+erha6Q/iMKGvHgKjPOPZNKZ2nuKZijN7ErrVTfA88haZa/A/gCeFCs/Ix04JJRmv4ELtAnyYmJQdAYmKr1xvfYlcDwdjPqzFwN8tdwBlnFtUjLXe+GGj0JFtSOIR/Tl8kRao3JaD88p+1zdScT+Zu85hqvb3W7tRa9CTnKVM7maoLrIjcCFyuPiOfNGd7B5lFbP3QBTODq5FqlPvKxNZ5TtBegu9acPAi/Eh32W/Zk5QTpIE3XFrBxKXam0Yp3ruVmFj8T5sDByik4ybcYvYsGEKz30x7JQ/TZ6mQwdfss8JKI1CpSoMxhx6C+TpH7DE4EAX2lnzeH6Sa8ZIlVdfgjGAsW0XuVrLh/VfL6vyOx1uWd2Lsl/AZTSHfyrQBZ+rToParG3S7QwLdFS+xfVX7HclZH+A9833cGl5lVPEAb9St6jTvbMxCOY0+E3n+tG/Xf9M88a7VJoE4fyfdLYOFcEOUQm+mnwQj+qJ4djY8w5ntwlnec/iZprxXgt6hjzCPyZ8tFzZaANrEiKI+0Srgq7xDSU3hHyGJrk25G0z2/ZvygLCsv4m54Y8oUKWqscN6nGsCjUFb4U1ahYc8afTi93ugpHHc+tu6AMMm1fmEvOv9qLDNWO2TDKYZxkbSDDpHRkcNkuCxX3gjyeifFFmofcZoLGbE4VehjDOfXeedik+mPOwFav02xpFbN9O2n1+M7TBWlavlmhpovT+p8kf+LNhquWKcJq5g89UqwZEtBygRlClzJ96TfAelMunTCMyjpIX5q/E86GRov2VGh0Z1qiF7nc4hbHwF3gu1GDLRr8439RCKdi46Gc2mvIzY8N/AJXyV25ffJeeBzUm/+BrvTx8n35DRzoMSUWpQBrv3AEQ2R/q4i5Syy2U+TRk8uOFsZpvoFm6ku1AdmH5wAtsn9k//A7EJXtW44gtLgV9Ijw6U9dK0Go7pV+WZKi7lfPQb7nfYmPAiGmczah9xTdpliYxL5KbAjuMwcRmXeUewA45Sw23GCkVI24Z/4u/4c9aJeRF8S6uTxYKE+DSZwUddu51xuAlyO09BOsEHdY83Tm/EVqV6tMTdF3mBNPhv/UesRKZY2gs7mE+cNLh+/MNtah5LzNWht9j4Umr0rmQ1cLHjg7RoYLOQYNvdYGGfP0W1mKze9IM+YljITh614YznkuT0gX2obQj22gWusIpwRo/pj+bm1NNro/Se5DvdafZUD0knlgnKKL8MdwNqkwuinOhe+WZYjLSgeZA5zPU+qAZAebjtLrit3oeLLjNzkyvmbqAw9cEys/DCFpvaAI6Ajmlx51xWikB41K4wzVqqapvwC6pNvkVe0hC+TQ862pJ4hos0+U6wgQ8l9qpodG2T1t9FCn0Oqcqswm07w/0ydez1ehJvQGqaduUZbA/qwSTgV7BZdWjepkV+EmARWaoNGoDE8y+4M3VFvJ00whoYE3wVYrd/CY7Xz4n3qhHtDyVyjlmqiHbblxpfJXWQ71yocMUr5zbiJ6wRvM5137eF+MBZhyN5T96tZ5kK5o7XMn6RvAq2kwUHzfc2xvmuAYUfAD81Gq4L8l0lla/FOR5x6FZYGl0hZ+FvO70pBu4R5pk7XcZk80gJWY9n0cClZLI2mx4AyddB2mzDWn4Ze0bncQWp9aA+4wh5yZmhfl8zH7bUKbHOfNI6F15E25RnWB9552gw+3/TyERxDf6TO1karG1O+4Ptzk8B0eSJOwDf1UVjnj1OJ3AxlMDPQu05I8TqC2Wiebw6qYJ9zWbCQbOe2a53xK7iddLeCTIZZomp0Nch0ZeAm3sn1cOZHj2rnywtAO/YlspHVXIvrnB07+5pvyTYxPZDOykJ1vI1PKMVmPrlNZXgnkyJ7LldvNif6URfgFNbIE7osil6qLODjXNVGTVDDmXg9fVdMNU/6rqAlwX0IEYHbK5/WlgrfIgcXo7YkFUenBsbpb3MNcqJ7ejnqls0i4wY8poykRGWa+aXzmvacGmg4oj+ZMeGRtkHKAaBok9xD5I1fbyZNniGBCt99ikOkIkv5nevkj7PXgl4abb6Ebcx9egkqeD3+c2Yq+xTNYNKkIPuJ+sQviz2F2eaakofFh9n/A0H/ff8="}, {"__id__": "chunk-b0c76d7dabe39a2ef5714186a6126fc0", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "Virgil also couple Malea, the dangerous promontory on the South of Laconia, with the Syrtes or quicksands of the Libyan coast.] [Footnote 409: Stars of the fruitful Leda.--Ver. 29. Commentators are divided upon the exact meaning of this line. Some think that it refers to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line of his Third Ode, B. i., 'Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,' 'The brothers of Helen, those brilliant stars.' Others think that it refers to the luminous appearances which were seen to settle on the masts of ships, and were called by the name of Castor and Pollux; they were thought to be of good omen when both appeared, but unlucky when seen singly.] [Footnote 410: In the couch.--Ver. 31. 'Torus' most probably means, in this place a sofa, on which the ladies would recline while reading.] [Footnote 411: Amusing books.--Ver. 31. By using the diminutive 'libellus' here, he probably means some light work, such as a bit of court scandal, of a love poem.] [Footnote 412: My Divinities.--Ver. 44. See the Second Epistle, 1. 126, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 413: As a table.--Ver. 48. This denotes his impatience to entertain her once again, and to hear the narrative of her adventures.] [Footnote 414: Though they be fictions.--Ver. 53. He gives a sly hit here at the tales of travellers.] [Footnote 415: Twice five years.--Ver. 9. Or the 'lustrum' of the Romans, see the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 166, and the Tristia, Book iv. El. 10.] [Footnote 416: And the cause.--Ver. 17. This passage is evidently misunderstood in Nisard's translation, 'Je ne serai pas non plus la caus d'une nouvelle guerre,' 'I will never more be the cause of a new war.'] [Footnote 417: A female again.--Ver. 22. He alludes to the war in Latium, between Æneas and Turnus, for the hand of Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus and Amata. See the narrative in the Fourteenth book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 421: 'Twas the females--Ver. 23. The rape of the Sabines, by the contrivance of Romulus, is here alluded to. The narrative will be found in the Third Book of the Fasti, 1. 203, et seq. It has been suggested, but apparently without any good grounds, that Tarpeia is here alluded to.] [Footnote 422: Thou who dost.--Ver. 7. Io was said to be worshipped under the name of Isis.] [Footnote 423: Parætonium.--Ver. 7. This city was situate at the Canopic mouth of the Nile, at the Western extremity of Egypt, adjoining to Libya. According to Strabo, its former name was Ammonia. It still preserves its ancient name in a great degree, as it is called al-Baretoun.] [Footnote 424: Fields of Canopus.--Ver. 7. Canopus was a city at one of the mouths of the Nile, now called Aboukir. The epithet 'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it was famous for its voluptuousness. Strabo tells us that there was a temple there dedicated to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from Alexandria. He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and women dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest licentiousness. The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and was about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria. Ovid gives a similar description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El. ii. 1. 79. See the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 425: Memphis.--Ver. 8. Memphis was a city situate on the North of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile. It was said to have been built by Osirit.] [Footnote 426: Pharos.--Ver. 8. See the Metamorphoses, Book ix. 1. 772, and Book xv. 1. 287, with the Notes to the passages.] [Footnote 428: By thy sistra. --Ver. 11. For an account of the mystic 'sistra' of Isis, see the Pontic Epistles, Book i. El. i. 1. 38, and the Note.] [Footnote 429: Anubis. --Ver. 11.

See the Metamorphoses, Book ix. 1. 692, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 431: The sluggish serpent.--Ver. 13. Macrobius tells us, that the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right, of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the right hand of the statue of the Deity. To this the Poet possibly alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and perhaps, was looked upon as sacred. If so, it is probable that the word 'pigra,' 'sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting of the asp, which was generally mortal. This, indeed, seems the more likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 93; which see, with the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver. 14. See the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 691, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 433: Thy features.--Ver. 15. Isis is here addressed, as being supposed to be the same Deity as Diana Lucina, who was invoked by pregnant and parturient women. Thus Isis appears to Telethusa, a Cretan woman, in her pregnancy, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 665, et seq.] [Footnote 434: Thy appointed days.--Ver. 17. Votaries who were worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice. In the First Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. i. 1. 50, Ovid says, 'I have beheld one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis, clothed in linen, sitting before he altars of Isis.'] [Footnote 435: On which.--Ver. 18. 'Queis' seems a preferable reading to 'qua.'] [Footnote 436: The Galli.--Ver. 18. Some suppose that Isis and Cybele were the same Divinity, and that the Galli, or priests of Cybele, attended the rites of their Goddess under the name of Isis. It seems clear, from the present passage, that the priests of Cybele, who were called Galli, did perform the rites of Isis, but there is abundant proof that these were considered as distinct Deities. In imitation of the Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele, they performed her rites to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and ran to and fro in a frenzied manner.] [Footnote 437: With thy laurels.--Ver. 18. See the Note to the 692nd line of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses. While celebrating the search for the limbs of Osiris, the priests uttered lamentations, accompanied with the sound of the 'sistra'; but when they had found the body, they wore wreaths of laurel, and uttered cries, signifying their joy.] [Footnote 438: Ilithyia.--Ver. 21. As to the Goddess Ilithyia, see the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 283, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 439: With their bucklers.--Ver. 2. Armed with 'peltæ,' or bucklers, like the Amazons.] [Footnote 440: The sand must.--Ver. 8. This figure is derived from the gladiatorial fights of the amphitheatre, where the spot on which they fought was strewed with sand, both for the purpose of giving a firm footing to the gladiators, and of soaking up the blood that was shed.] [Footnote 441: Again throw stones.--Ver. 12. He alludes to Deucalion and Pyr-rha. See the First Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 442: Ilia had destroyed.--Ver. 16. Romulus was her son. See her story, related at the beginning of the Third Book of the Fasti.] [Footnote 443: Why pierce.--Ver. 27. He alludes to the sharp instruments which she had used for the purpose of procuring abortion: a practice which Canace tells Macareus that her nurse had resorted to. Epistle xi. 1. 40--43.] [Footnote 444: Armenian dens.--Ver. 35. See the Metamorphoses, Book viii. 1. 126, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 445: Many a time.--Ver. 38. He seems here to speak of this practice as being frequently resorted to.] [Footnote 446: She deserved it.--Ver. 40. From this, it would seem that the practice was considered censurable; but, perhaps it was one of those cases whose heinousness is never fully discovered till it has brought about its own punishment.] [Footnote 447: O ring.--Ver. 1.

See the Note to the first line of the First Elegy of this Book.] [Footnote 461: Pelignian land.--Ver. 1. From Pliny the Elder, we learn that the Peligni were divided into three tribes, the Corfinienses, the Superequani, and the Sulmonenses.] [Footnote 462: Constellation.--Ver. 4. He alludes to the heat attending the Dog star, see the Fasti, Book iv., 1. 939, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 463: The thin soil.--Ver. 8. 'Rarus ager' means, a 'thin' or 'loose' soil, which was well suited for the cultivation of the grape.] [Footnote 464: That bears its berries.--Ver. 8. In Nisard's translation, the words 'bacciferam Pallada,' which mean the olive, are rendered 'L'amande Caere Pallas,' 'the almond dear to Pallas.'] [Footnote 465: Lengthened tracks.--Ver. 16. To the Delphin Editor this seems a silly expression.] [Footnote 466: The stormy Alps.--Ver. 19. See the Metamorphoses, Book ii. 1. 226, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 467: The obedient stream.--Ver. 35. This was a method of irrigation in agriculture, much resorted to by the ancients.] [Footnote 468: Fierce Cilicians --Ver. 39. The people of the interior of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, were of rude and savage manners while those on the coast had been engaged in piracy, until it had been effectually suppressed by Pompey.] [Footnote 469: Britons painted green.--Ver. 39. The Britons may be called 'virides,' from their island being surrounded by the sea; or, more probably, from the colour with which they were in the habit of staining their bodies. Cæsar says, in the Fifth Book of the Gallic war, 'The Britons stain themselves with woad, 'vitrum,' or 'glastum,' which produces a blue colour: and thus they become of a more dreadful appearance in battle.' The conquest of Britain, by Cæsar, is alluded to in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 752.] [Footnote 471: Loves the vine.--Ver. 41. The custom of training vines by the side of the elm, has been alluded to in a previous Note. See also the Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 663, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 472: As the nags.--Ver. 49. The 'manni' were used by the Romans for much the same purpose as our coach-horses; and were probably more noted for their fleetness than their strength; They were a small breed, originally imported from Gaul, and the possession of them was supposed to indicate the possession of considerable wealth. As the 'esseda' was a small vehicle, and probably of light structure, we must not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of driving for herself. The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety miles: and the journey, from his expressions in the fifty-first and fifty-second lines, must have been over hill and dale.] [Footnote 473: Your little chaise.--Ver. 49.

It is a somewhat curious fact, that the anvils of the ancients exactly resembled in form and every particular those used at the present day.] [Footnote 476: Becomingly united.--Ver. 22. He says, that in the Elegiac measure the Pentameter, or line of five feet, is not unhappily matched with the Hexameter, or heroic line of six feet.] [Footnote 477: Disavowed by you.--Ver. 26. 'Voids' seems more agreable to the sense of the passage, than 'nobis.' 'to be denied by us;' as, from the context, there was no fear of his declining her affection.] [Footnote 478: That she is Corinna.--Ver. 29. This clearly proves that Corinna was not a real name; it probably was not given by the Poet to any one of his female acquaintances in particular.] [Footnote 479: Thy poem onwards.--Ver. 1. Macer translated the Iliad of Homer into Latin verse, and composed an additional poem, commencing at the beginning of the Trojan war, and coming down to the wrath of Achilles, with which Homer begins.] [Footnote 480: I, Macer.--Ver. 3. Æmilius Macer is often mentioned by Ovid in his works. In the Tristia, Book iv. Ep. 10,1.41, he says, 'Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me his poem on birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb that is curative.' The Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic Epistles is also addressed to him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on the Trojan war, and the time when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily together. He speaks of him in the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as being then dead. Macer was a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend of Virgil, Ovid, and Tibullus. Some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history, was not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war; and, indeed, it does not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six years of age. The bard of Ilium died in Asia.] [Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver. 13. He alludes to his tragedy of Medea, which no longer exists. Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The Medea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had only preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'] [Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver. 27. He represents his friend, Sabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,' going with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and bringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra, Æneas to Dido, Demophoôn to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to Sappho. All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of Ulysses to Penelope, and Demophoôn to Phyllis. His Epistle from Paris to Oenonc, is not here mentioned. See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 13, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver. 28. As the ancients had no establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special messengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.] [Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver. 34. Sappho says in her Epistle, that if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to Phobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock. This, he tells her, she may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.] [Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver. 11. She pretended a head-ache, when nothing wras the matter with her; in order that too much familiarity, in the end, might not breed contempt.] [Footnote 486: A surfeit of love.--Ver. 25. 'l'inguis amor' seems here to mear a satisfied 'ora 'pampered passion;' one that meets with no repulse.] [Footnote 487: Enclosed Danaë.--Ver. 27. See the Metamorphoses, Book iv., 1.] [Footnote 488: The dogs bark.--Ver. 40. The women of loose character, among the Romans, were much in the habit of keeping dogs, for the protection of their houses.] FOOTNOTES BOOK THREE: [Footnote 501: Than the other.--Ver. 8. 'He alludes to the unequal lines of the Elegiac measure, which consists of Hexameters and Pentameters.

In personifying Elegy, he might have omitted this remark, as it does not add to the attractions of a lady, to have one foot longer than the other; he says, however, that it added to her gracefulness.] [Footnote 502: The Lydian buskin.--Ver. 14. As Lydia was said to have sent colonists to Etruria, some Commentators think that the word 'Lydius' here means 'Etrurian and that the first actors at Rome were Etrurians. But, as the Romans derived their notions of tragedy from the Greeks, we may conclude that Lydia in Asia Minor is here referred to; for we learn from Herodotus and other historians, that the Greeks borrowed largely from the Lydians.] [Footnote 503: Drunken revels.--Ver. 17. He probably alludes to the Fourth Elegy of the First, and the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the 'Amores.'] [Footnote 505: Mighty inspiration.--Ver. 23. The 'thyrsus' was said to have been first used by the troops of Bacchus, in his Indian expedition, when, to deceive the Indians, they concealed the points of their spears amid leaves of the vine and ivy. Similar weapons were used by his devotees when worshipping him, which they brandished to and fro. To be touched with the thyrsus of Bacchus, meant 'to be inspired with poetic frenzy.' See the Notes to the Metamorphoses, Book iii. 1. 542.] [Footnote 506: In unequal numbers.--Ver. 37. Some have supposed, that allusion is made to the Tragedy of Medea, which Ovid had composed, and that it had been written in Elegiac measure. This, however, does not seem to be the meaning of the passage. Elegy justly asks Tragedy, why, if she has such a dislike to Elegiac verses, she has been talking in them? which she has done, from the 15th line to the 30th.] [Footnote 507: Myself the patroness.--Ver. 44. She certainly does not give herself a very high character in giving herself the title of 'lena.'] [Footnote 508: The fastened door.--Ver. 50. He alludes, probably, to one of the Elegies which he rejected, when he cut down the five books to three.] [Footnote 509: In a hose tunic.--Ver. 51. He may possibly allude to the Fifth Elegy of the First Book, as the words 'tunicâ velata recinctâ,' as applied to Corinna, are there found. But there he mentions midday as the time when Corinna came to him, whereas he seems here to allude to the middle of the night.] [Footnote 510: Cut in the wood.--Ver. 53. He alludes to the custom of lovers carving inscriptions on the doors of their obdurate mistresses: this we learn from Plautus to have been done in Elegiac strains, and sometimes with charcoal. 'Implentur meæ fores clegiarum carbonibus.' 'My doors are filled with the coal-black marks of elegies.'] [Footnote 511: On her birthday.--Ver. 57. She is telling Ovid what she has put up with for his sake; and she reminds him how, when he sent to his mistress some complimentary lines on her birthday, she tore them up and threw them in the water. Horace mentions 'the flames, or the Adriatic sea,' as the end of verses that displeased. Athenseus, Book xiii. c. 5, relates a somewhat similai story. Diphilus the poet was in the habit of sending his verses to his mistress Gnathæna. One day she was mixing him a cup of wine and snow-water, on which he observed, how cold her well must be; to which she answered, yes, for it was there that she used to throw his compositions.] [Footnote 514: From behind.--Ver. 70. It is not known, for certain, to what he refers in this line. Some think that he refers to the succeeding Elegies in this Book, which are, in general, longer than the former ones, while others suppose that he refers to his Metamorphoses, which he then contemplated writing. Burmann, however, is not satisfied with this explanation, and thinks that, in his more mature years, he contemplated the composition of Tragedy, after having devoted his youth to lighter snbjects; and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the composition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.] [Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver. 1. He is here alluding to the Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or greatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year. Some account is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1. 392. of the Second Book of the Fasti. The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the Fourth of the Ides of April. The buildings of the Circus were burnt in the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former magnificence, and made it capable", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-eb4eb8f1e4cf05e01dcfb95969a6bb79", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ". Some account is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1. 392. of the Second Book of the Fasti. The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the Fourth of the Ides of April. The buildings of the Circus were burnt in the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former magnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of accommodating 385,000 persons. The Poet says, that he takes no particular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may win which is her favourite.] [Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver. 2. The usual number of chariots in each race was four. The charioteers were divided into four companies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing the season of the year. These colours were green for the spring, red for the summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter. Originally, but two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number to six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the purple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four. The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in the race. Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and colours; the names also of the charioteers were given, and bets were extensively made, (see the Art of Love, Book i. 1. 167, 168,) and sometimes disputes and violent contests arose.] [Footnote 517: To be seated by you.--Ver. 3. The men and women sat together when viewing the contests of the Circus, and not in separate parts of the building, as at the theatres.] [Footnote 518: Happy the driver.--Ver. 7. He addresses the charioteer.] [Footnote 519: The sacred barrier.--Ver. 9. For an account of the 'career,' or 'starting-place,' see the Notes to the Tristia, Book v. El. ix. 1. 29. It is called 'sacer,' because the whole of the Circus Maximus was sacred to Consus, who is supposed by some to have been the same Deity as Neptune. The games commenced with sacrifices to the Deities.] [Footnote 520: I would give rein.--Ver. 11. The charioteer was wont to stand within the reins, having them thrown round his back. Leaning backwards, he thereby threw his full weight against the horses, when he wished to check them at full speed. This practice, however, was dangerous, and by it the death of Hippolytus was caused. In the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses,1. 524, he says, 'I struggled, with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and throwing myself \"backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.' To avoid the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked knife at his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.] [Footnote 521: The turning-place.--Ver. 12. For an account of the 'meta.'see the Tristia, Book iv. El. viii.l. 35. Of course, thpse who kept as close to the 'meta' as possible, would lose the least distance in turning round it.] [Footnote 522: How nearly was Pelops.--Ver. 15. In his race with Onomaüs, king of Pisa, in Arcadia, for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia, when Pelops conquered his adversary by bribing his charioteer, Myrtilus.] [Footnote 523: Of his mistress.--Ver. 17. He here seems to imply that it was Hippodamia who bribed Myrtilus.] [Footnote 524: Shrink away in vain.--Ver. 19. She shrinks from him, and seems to think that he is sitting too close, but he tells her that the 'linea' forces them to squeeze. This 'linea' is supposed to have been either cord, or a groove, drawn across the seats at regular intervals, so as to mark out room for a certain number of spectators between each two 'lineæ.'] [Footnote 525: Has this advantage.--Ver. 20. He congratulates himsdf on the construction of the place, so aptly giving him an excuse for sitting close to his mistress.] [Footnote 526: But do you --Ver. 21. He is pretending to be very anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not to squeeze so close against his mistress.] [Footnote 527: And you as well.--Ver. 23. As in the theatres, the seats, which were called 'gradas,' 'sedilia,' or 'subsellia,' were arranged round the course of the Circus, in ascending tiers; the lowest being, very probably, almost flush with the ground. There were, perhaps, no backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood. The knees consequently of those in the back row would be level, and in juxta-position with the backs of those in front. He is here telling the person who is sitting behind, to be good enough to keep his knees to himself, and not to hurt the lady's back by pressing against her.] [Footnote 528: I am taking it up.--Ver. 26.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-b58bef5f729853c059776366ebdfa6e2", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ", perhaps, no backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood.

He is here showing off his politeness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress. Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their dresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.] [Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver. 29. Some suppose that the Arcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the name of Milanion. According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds the Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of Hippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses. See the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p. 375. From this and another passage of Ovid, we have reason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty of her ancles.] [Footnote 530: The fan may cause.--Ver. 38. Instead of the word 'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but as the first syllable is long, such a reading would occasion a violation of the laws of metre, and 'tabella' is probably correct. It has, however, the same meaning here as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a fan;' in fact, the 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with peacocks' feathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated pieces of cloth. These were generally waved by female slaves, who were called 'flabelliferæ'; or else by eunuchs or young boys. They were used to cool the atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep. We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it must have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman Circus. That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving away flies, was called 'muscarium.' The use of fans was not confined to females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had a slave to fan him during his sleep. The fan was also sometimes made of linen, extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a bird, joined back to back, and attached to a handle.] [Footnote 531: Now the procession.--Ver. 34 All this time they have been waiting for the ceremony to commence. The 'Pompa,' or procession, now opens the performance. In this all those who were about to exhibit in the race took a part. The statues of the Gods were borne on wooden platforms on the shoulders of men, or on wheels, according as they were light or heavy. The procession moved from the Capitol, through the Forum, to the Circus Maximus, and was also attended by the officers of state. Musicians and dancers preceded the statues of the Gods. See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 391, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 532: Victory borne.--Ver. 45. On the wooden platform, which was called 'ferculum,' or 'thensa,' according as it was small or large.] [Footnote 533: With expanded wings.--Ver. 45. Victory was always represented with expanded wings, on account of her inconstancy and volatility.] [Footnote 534: Salute Neptune.--Ver. 47. 'Plaudite Neptuno' is equivalent, in our common parlance, to 'Give a cheer for Neptune.' He is addressing the sailors who may be present: but he declines to have anything to do with the sea himself.] [Footnote 535: Arms I detest.--Ver. 49. Like his contemporary, Horace, Ovid was no lover of war.] [Footnote 536: Of the artisan.--Ver. 52. We learn from the Fasti, Book iii. 1.815, that Minerva was especially venerated as the patroness of handicrafts.] [Footnote 537: Let the boxers.--Ver. 54. Boxing was one of the earliest athletic games practised by the Greeks. Apollo and Hercules, as well as Pollux, are celebrated by the poets for excelling in this exercise. It formed a portion of the Olympic contests; while boys fought in the Nemean and Isthmian games. Concerning the 'cæstus' used by pugilists, see the Fasti, Book ii. 1. 367, and the Note to the passage. The method in fighting most practised was to remain on the defensive, and thus to wear out the opponent by continual efforts. To inflict blows, without receiving any in return on the body, was the great point of merit. The right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was to protect the body.

The right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was to protect the body. Teeth were often knocked out, and the ears were much disfigured. The boxers, by the rules of the game, were not allowed to take hold of each other, nor to trip up their antagonist. In Italy boxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of Etruria. It continued to be one of the popular games during the period of the Republic as well as of the Empire.] [Footnote 538: In the lattice work.--Ver. 64. The 'cancelli' were lattice work, which probably fkirted the outer edge of each wide 'præcinctio,' or passage,that ran along in front of the seats, at certain intervals. As the knees would not there be so cramped, these seats would be considered the most desirable. It is clear that Ovid and the lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the feet resting either on the lowest 'præcinctio', or the 'præcinctio' of a set of seats higher up. Stools, of course, could not be used, as they would be in the way of passers-by. He perceives, as the seat is high, that she has some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and naturally concludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it will give her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work railing which was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper 'præcinctio,' ran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest tier, skirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that tier. This she might do, if the 'præcinctio' was not more than a yard wide, and if the 'cancelli' were as much as a foot in height.] [Footnote 539: Now the Prcetor.--Ver. 65. The course is now clear of the procession, and the Prætor gives the signal for the start, the 'carceres' being first opened. This was sometimes given by sound of trumpet, or more frequently by letting fall a napkin; at least, after the time of Nero, who is said, on one occasion, while taking a meal, to have heard the shouts of the people who were impatient for the race to begin, on which he threw down his napkin as the signal.] [Footnote 540: The even harriers.--Ver. 66. From this description we should be apt to think that the start was effected at the instant when the 'carceres' were opened. This was not the case: for after coming out of the-carceres,' the chariots were ranged abreast before a white line, which was held by men whose office it was to do, and who were called 'moratores.' When all were ready, and the signal had been given, the white line was thrown down, and the race commenced, which was seven times round the course. The 'career' is called 'æquum,' because they were in a straight line, and each chariot was ranged in front of the door of its 'career.'] [Footnote 541: Circuit far too wide.--Ver. 69. The charioteer, whom the lady favours, is going too wide of the 'meta,' or turning-place, and so loses ground, while the next overtakes him.] [Footnote 542: To the left.--Ver. 72. He tells him to guide the horses to the left, so as to keep closer to the 'meta,' and not to lose so much ground by going wide of it.] [Footnote 543: Call him back again.--Ver. 73. He, by accident, lets drop the observation, that they have been interesting themselves for a blockhead. But he immediately checks himself, and, anxious that the favourite may yet distinguish himself, trusts that the spectators will call him back. Crispinus, the Delphin Editor, thinks, that by the calling back, it is meant that it was a false start, and that the race was to be run over again. Bur-mann, however, is not of that opinion; but supposes, that if any chariot did not go well, or the horses seemed jaded, it was the custom to call the driver back from the present race, that with new horses he might join in the next race. This, from the sequel, seems the most rational mode of explanation here.] [Footnote 544: Waving the garments.--Ver. 74. The signal for stopping was given by the men rising and shaking and waving their outer garments, or 'togae,' and probably calling the charioteer by name.] [Footnote 545: Disarrange your hair.--Ver. 75. He is afraid lest her neighbours, in their vehemence should discommode her hair, and tells her, in joke, that she may creep into the bosom of his own 'toga.'] [Footnote 546: And now the barrier.--Ver. 77. The first race we are to suppose finished, and the second begins similarly to the first. There were generally twenty-five of these 'missus,' or races in a day.] [Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver. 78. See the Note to the second line.] [Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver. 79. He addresses the favourite, who has again started in this race.] [Footnote 549: Bears", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-a0dd004d7bb30cbae402f5f620fd614a", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ". 77.

There were generally twenty-five of these 'missus,' or races in a day.] [Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver. 78. See the Note to the second line.] [Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver. 79. He addresses the favourite, who has again started in this race.] [Footnote 549: Bears away the palm.--Ver. 82. The favourite charioteer is now victorious, and the Poet hopes that he himself may gain the palm in like manner. The victor descended from his car at the end of the race, and ascended the 'spina,' where he received his reward, which was generally a considerable sum of money. For an account of the 'spina,' see the Metamorphoses, Book x. l. 106, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 550: Her beauty remains.--Ver. 2. She has not been punished with ugliness, as a judgment for her treachery.] [Footnote 551: Proved false to me.--Ver. 10. Tibullus has a similar passage, 'Et si perque suos fallax juravit ocellos 'and if with her eyes the deceitful damsel is forsworn.'] [Footnote 552: Its divine sway.--Ver. 12. 'Numen' here means a power equal to that of the Divinities, and which puts it on a level with them.] [Footnote 553: Mine felt pain.--Ver. 14. When the damsel swore by them, his eyes smarted, as though conscious of her perjury.] [Footnote 554: Forsooth to you.--Ver. 17. He says that surely it was enough for the Gods to punish Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, for the sins of her mother, without making him to suffer misery for the perjury of his mistress. Cassiope, the mother of Andromeda, having dared to compare her own beauty with that of the Nereids, her daughter was, by the command of Jupiter, exposed to a sea-monster, which was afterwards slain by Perseus. See the Metamorphoses, Book iv. 1. 670.] [Footnote 555: Hurls at the groves.--Ver. 35. A place which had been struck by lightning was called 'bidental,' and was held sacred ever afterwards. The same veneration was also paid to a place where any person who had been killed by lightning was buried. Priests collected the earth that had been torn up by lightning, and everything that had been scorched, and buried it in the ground with lamentations. The spot was then consecrated by sacrificing a two-year-old sheep, which being called 'bidens,' gave its name to the place. An altar was also erected there, and it was not allowable thenceforth to tread on the spot, or to touch it, or even look at it. When the altar had fallen to decay, it might be renovated, but to remove its boundaries was deemed sacrilege. Madness was supposed to ensue on committing such an offence; and Seneca mentions a belief, that wine which had been struck by lightning, would produce death or madness in those who drank it.] [Footnote 556: Unfortunate Semele.--Ver. 37. See the fate of Semele, related in the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 557: Have some regard.--Ver. 49. Or, in other words. 'Don't sweat any more by my eyes.'] [Footnote 558: Because she cannot, stilt sews.--Ver. 4. It is not a little singular that a heathen poet should enunciate the moral doctrine of the New Testament, that it is the thought, and not the action, that of necessity constitutes the sin.] [Footnote 559: A hundred in his neck.--Ver. 18. In the First Book of the Metamorphoses, he assigns to Argus only one hundred eyes; here, however, he uses a poet's license, prohably for the sake of filling up the line.] [Footnote 560: Its stone and its iron.--Ver. 21. From Pausanias and Lucian we learn that the chamber of Danaë was under ground, and was lined with copper and iron.] [Footnote 561: Nor yet is it legal.--Ver. 33. He tells him that he ought not to inflict loss of liberty on a free-born woman, a punishment that was only suited to a slave.] [Footnote 562: Those two qualities.--Ver. 42. He says, the wish being probably the father to the thought, that beauty and chastity cannot possibly exist together.] [Footnote 563: Many a thing at home.--Ver. 48. He tells him that he will grow quite rich with the presents which his wife will then receive from her admirers.] [Footnote 564: Its bubbling foam..--Ver. 13. He alludes to the noise which the milk makes at the moment when it touches that in the pail.] [Footnote 565: Ewe when milked.--Ver. 14.

We have been already introduced to one amiable specimen of this class in the Eighth Elegy of the First Book.] [Footnote 567: River that hast.--Ver. 1. Ciofanus has this interesting Note:--'This river is that which flows near the walls of Sulmo, and, which, at the present day we call 'Vella.' In the early spring, when the snows melt, and sometimes, at the beginning of autumn, it swells to a wonderful degree with the rains, so that it becomes quite impassable. Ovid lived not far from the Fountain of Love, at the foot of the Moronian hill, and had a house there, of which considerable vestiges still remain, and are called 'la botteghe d'Ovidio.' Wishing to go thence to the town of Sulmo, where his mistress was living, this river was an obstruction to his passage.'] [Footnote 568: A hollow boat.--Ver. 4. 'Cymba' was a name given to small boats used on rivers or lakes. He here alludes to a ferry-boat, which was not rowed over; but a chain or rope extending from one side of the stream to the other, the boatman passed across by running his hands along the rope.] [Footnote 569: The opposite mountain.--Ver. 7. The mountain of Soracte was near the Flaminian way, in the territory of the Falisci, and may possibly be the one here alluded to. Ciofanus says that its name is now 'Majella,-and that it is equal in height to the loftiest mountains of Italy, and capped with eternal snow. All one with the day.--Ver. 10. He means to say that he has risen early in the morning for the purpose of proceeding on his journey.] [Footnote 570: The son of Danaë.--Ver. 13. Mercury was said to have lent to Perseus his winged shoes, 'talaria,' when he slew Medusa with her viperous locks.] [Footnote 571: Wish for the chariot.--Ver. 15. Ceres was said to have sent Trip-tolemus in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, to introduce agriculture among mankind. See the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1. 558.] [Footnote 572: Inachus.--Ver. 25. Inachus was a river of Argolis, in Peloponnesus.] [Footnote 573: Love for Melie.--Ver. 25. Melie was a Nymph beloved by Neptune, to whom she bore Amycus, king of Bebrycia, or Bithynia, in Asia Minor, whence her present appellation.] [Footnote 574: Alpheus.--Ver 29. See the story of Alpheus and Arethusa, in the Fifth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 576.] [Footnote 575: Creüsa.--Ver. 31. Creüsa was a Naïad, the mother of Hypseas, king of the Lapithae, by Peneus, a river of Thessaly. Xanthus was a rivulet near Troy. Of Creüsa being promised to Xanthus nothing whatever is known.] [Footnote 576: The be beloved by Mars.--Ver. 33. Pindar, in his Sixth Olympic Ode, says that Metope, the daughter of Ladon, was the mother of live daughters, by Asopus, a river of Boeotia. Their names were Corcyra, Ægina, Salamis, Thebe, and Harpinna. Ovid, in calling her Thebe, probably follows some other writer. She is called 'Martia,' because she was beloved by Mars, to whom she bore Evadne.] [Footnote 577: Hand of Hercules.--Ver. 36. For the contest of Hercules and Achelous for the hand of Deianira, see the beginning of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 578: Calydon.--Ver. 37. Aeneus, the father of Meleager and Dei'anira, reigned over Ætolia, of which Calydon was the chief city.] [Footnote 579: The native spot.--Ver. 40; He alludes to the fact of the source or native country of the Nile being then, as it probably still is, quite unknown.] [Footnote 580: Daughter of Asopus.--Ver. 41. Evadne is called 'Asopide,' from her mother being the wife of Asopus. See the Note on line 33 above.] [Footnote 581: Enipeus dried up.--Ver. 43. Probably the true reading here is 'fictus,' 'the false Enipeus.' Tyro was the daughter of Salmoneus, king of Pisa, in Elis. She being much enamoured of the river Enipeus, Neptune is said to have assumed his form, and to have been, by her, the father of Pelias and Neleus.'] [Footnote 582: Argive Tibur,--Ver. 46.

Tibur was a town beautifully situate in the neighbourhood of Home; it was said to have been founded by three Argive brothers, Tyburtus, Catillus, and Coras.] [Footnote 583: Whom Ilia.--Ver. 47. Ilia was said to have been buried alive, by the orders of Amulius, on the banks of the river Tiber; or, according to some, to have been thrown into that river, on which she is said to have become the wife of the river, and was deified. Acron, an ancient historian, wrote to the effect that her ashes were interred on the banks of the Anio; and that river overflowing, carried them to the bed of the Tiber, whence arose the story of her nuptials with the latter. According to one account, she was not put to death, but was imprisoned, having been spared by Amulius at the entreaty of his daughter, who was of the same age as herself, and at length regained her liberty.] [Footnote 584: Descendant of Laomedon.--Ver. 54. She was supposed to be descended from Laomedon, through Ascanius, the son of Creüsa, the granddaughter of Laomedon.] [Footnote 585: No white fillet.--Ver. 56. The fillet with which the Vestals bound their hair.] [Footnote 586: Am I courted.--Ver. 75. The Vestais were released from their duties, and were allowed to marry if they chose, after they had served for thirty years. The first ten years were passed in learning their duties, the next ten in performing them, and the last ten in instructing the novices.] [Footnote 587: Did she throw herself.--Ver. 80. The Poet follows the account which represented her as drowning herself.] [Footnote 588: To some fixed rule.--Ver. 89. 'Legitimum' means 'according to fixed laws so that it might be depended upon, 'in a steady manner.'] [Footnote 589: Injurious to the flocks.--Ver. 99. It would be 'damnosus' in many ways, especially from its sweeping away the cattle and the produce of the land. Its waters, too, being turbid, would be unpalatable to the thirsty traveller, and unwholesome from the melted snow, which would be likely to produce goitre, or swellings in the throat.] [Footnote 590: Could I speak of the rivers.--Ver. 103. He apologizes to the Acheloüs, Inachus, and Nile, for presuming to mention their names, in addressing such a turbid, contemptible stream.] [Footnote 591: After my poems.--Ver. 5. He refers to his lighter works; such, perhaps, as the previous books of his Amores. This explains the nature of the 'libelli,' which he refers to in his address to his mistress, in the Second Book of the Amores, El. xi. 1. 31.] [Footnote 592: His wealth acquired.--Ver. 9. 'Censu.' For the explanation of this word, see the Fasti, B. i. 1. 217, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 593: Through his wounds.--Ver. 9. In battle, either by giving wounds, or receiving them.] [Footnote 594: Which thus late.--Ver. 15. By 4 serum,'he means that his position, as a man of respectable station, has only been recently acquired, and has not descended to him through a long line of ancestors.] [Footnote 595: Was it acquired.--Ver. 20. This was really much to the merit of his rival; but most of the higher classes of the Romans affected to despise anything like gain by means of bodily exertion; and the Poet has extended this feeling even to the rewards of merit as a soldier.] [Footnote 596: Hold sway over.--Ver. 27. He here plays upon the two meanings of the word 'deducere.' 'Deducere carmen' is 'to compose poetry'; 'deducere primum pilum' means 'to form' or 'command the first troop of the Triarii.' These were the veteran soldiers of the Roman army, and the 'Primipilus' (which office is here alluded to) being the first Centurion of the first maniple of them, was the chief Centurion of the legion, holding an office somewhat similar to our senior captains. Under the Empire this office was very lucrative. See the Note to the 49th line of the Seventh Epistle, in the-Fourth Book of the Pontic Epistles.] [Footnote 597: The ravished damsel.--Ver. 30. He alludes to Danaë.] [Footnote 598: Resorted to presents.--Ver. 33.

He seems to allude to the real meaning of the story of Danaë, which, no doubt, had reference to the corrupting influence of money.] [Footnote 599: With no boundaries.--Ver. 42. The 'limes' was a line or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones. The 'ager limitatus' was the public land marked out by 'limites,' for the purposes of allotment to the citizens. On apportioning the land, a line, which was called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East to West, which was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from North to South. The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn depended on the magnitude of the squares or 'centuriæ,' as they were called, into which it was purposed to divide the tract.] [Footnote 601: Then was the shore.--Ver. 44. Because they had not as yet learnt the art of navigation.] [Footnote 602: Turreted fortifications.--Ver. 47. Among the ancients the fortifications of cities were strengthened by towers, which were placed at intervals on the walls; they were also generally used at the gates of towns.] [Footnote 603: Why not seek the heavens.--Ver. 50. With what indignation would he not have spoken of a balloon, as being nothing less than a downright attempt to scale the 'tertia régna!'] [Footnote 604: Ciesar but recently.--Ver. 52. See the end of the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, and the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 704.] [Footnote 605: The Senate-house.--Ver. 55. 'Curia'was the name of the place where the Senate held its meetings, such as the 'curia Hostilia,' Julia,' Marcelli,' and others. Hence arose the custom of calling the Senate itself, in the various Roman towns, by the name of 'curia,' but not the Senate of Rome. He here means to say, that poverty excluded a man from the Senate-house, and that wealth alone was the qualification for the honours of the state.] [Footnote 606: Wealth alone confers honours --Ver. 55. The same expression occurs in the Fasti, Book i. 1. '217, where a similar complaint is made on the worldly-mindedness of the age.] [Footnote 607: The Field of Mars.--Ver. 57. The 'comitia,' or meetings for the elections of the magistrates, were held on the 'Campus Martius' or field of Mars. See the Notes to the Fasti, Book i. 1. 53.] [Footnote 608: And the Forum. --Ver. 57. The 'Fora' were of two kinds at Rome; some being market-places, where all kinds of goods were exposed for sale, while others were solely courts of justice. Among the latter is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after that period, as in the present instance. At a later period of the Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets 'vetus,' 'old,' or 'magnum, 'great.' It was situate between the Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh, which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius. It was chiefly used for judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.' Gladiatorial games were occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless legionary soldiers, were there put to death. A second 'Forum,' for judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his name. It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix. A third was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men of the republic. Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was restored by the Emperor Hadrian. It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. xv. 1. 16. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 704.] [Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver. 63. He says that because he is poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband and those whom he has set to watch her.] [Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver. 5. Burmann remarks, that the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods; literally 'the priest of thy rites.'] [Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver. 6. Among the Romans the corpse was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.' According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed by the Latin writers.] It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the deceased. On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands, were thrown upon it.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1c9d540a7609b6ba4c69dd1651e5329e", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "was called by the former name before, and hy the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed by the Latin writers.] It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the deceased.

Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were sometimes used for the same purpose. This was done not only by the family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral procession.] [Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver. 16. He alludes to the death of Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh. See the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses, l. 716.] [Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver. 17. In the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 6, he says. 'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the impregnating. particles of the mind of the Divinity.'] [Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver. 20. It must be remembered that, whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans represented the grim tyrant as being a female. It is a curious fact that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman monuments. The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii. The head of a horse was one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified departure.] [Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver. 21. Apollo and the Muse Calliope were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death. See the beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 616: Linus! Alas!--Ver. 23. 'Ælinon' was said to have been the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus. The word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas! Linus.' A certain poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus, that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects. There appear to have been two persons of the name of Linus. One was a Theban, the son of Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.] [Footnote 617: The son of Mæon. --Ver. 25. See the Note to the ninth line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.] [Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver. 30. The web of Penelope.] [Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver. 31. Nemesis and Delia were the names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.] [Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver. 33. He alludes to two lines in the] First Elegy of Tibullus.] 'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia? quid mihi prosunt] Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.'] What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis? what avail me those sistra so often shaken by your hand?'] [Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver. 34. During the festival of Isis, all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.] [Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver. 38. The place where a person was burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot, and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place. See the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii. 1. 531.] [Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver. 45. He alludes to Venus, who had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.] [Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver. 47. The Phæacians were the ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu. Tibullus had attended Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among the Phæacians. To this Elegy Ovid here refers. Tibullus afterwards recovered, and died at Rome. When he penned this line, Ovid little thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of civilization.] [Footnote 625: Here.--Ver. 49. 1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.] [Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver. 49.

He alludes to the custom of the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.] [Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver. 50. The perfumes and other offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to. Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--] 'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,] Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis'] 'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes, and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.' To this passage Ovid makes reference in the next two lines.] [Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver. 53. 'Prior;' his former love was Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis. They are both represented here as attending his obsequies. Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of the First Book, addressing Delia:--] 1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,] Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.] Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,] Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.'] May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you with my failing hand. Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears of grief.' To these lines Ovid evidently here refers. It would appear from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss when the body was laid on the funeral pile.] [Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver. 58. Nemesis here alludes to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.] [Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver. 62. Catullus was a Roman poet, a native of Verona. Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit. The poems of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and Demetrius, who were famous composers. See the Tristia, Book ii. lines 427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.] [Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver. 64. He alludes to the fact of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 446, that the fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when he was in a state o inebriety. Some writers say, that when Governor of Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids, and that this constituted his crime. Others again, suppose that he was guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people of Thebea with his exactions. Some of the Commentators think that under the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known to have existed. Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.] [Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver. 1. This festival of Ceres occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that month. See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 393. White garments, were worn at this festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited. The worship was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.] [Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver. 9. On the oaks, the oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253 and 467.] [Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver. 20. See an account of the education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of the Fasti, L 499, et seq.] [Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver. 25. Iasius, or Iasion, was, according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus. According to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph Phronia. According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres. He was also said by some to be the husband of Cybele. He is supposed to have been a successful husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres. Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 300. See the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 636:", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-64676dc63a3bd3d7dc906d1feffc619e", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "of Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.

With less corn than had been originally sown.] [Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver. 41. Minos is said to have been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.] [Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver. 6. This figure is derived from the horns, the weapons of the bull. 'At length I have assumed the weapons of defence.' It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.' 'Too late, alas! I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!] [Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver. 7. He addresses himself, recommending fortitude as his only cure.] [Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver. 10. At the door of his mistress; a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman lovers.] [Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver. 15. As, of courser, his rival would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.] [Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver. 17. By the use of the word 'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.] [Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver. 22. This forms the subject of the Third Elegy of the present Book.] [Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver. 23. See the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the Amores.] [Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver. 26. When he arrived, he found his rival in her company.] [Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver. 35. This and the next line are considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.] [Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver. 5. Commentators are at a loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book, when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses. If Corinna was anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.] [Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver. 9. He says that, unconsciously, he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending his mistress to the public. The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered for sale. These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the 'magister auctionum.' The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals, to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry them and search for them. The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.] [Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver. 15. He speaks of the Theban war, the Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time in singing in praise of Corinna. This, however, may be said in reproof of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that Corinna is the cause of his present complaint. The Roman poet Statius afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.] [Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver. 19. That is, 'to rely implicitly on the testimony of poets.' The word 'poetas' requires a semicolon after it, and not a comma.] [Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver. 21. He here falls into his usual mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.

See the Note to 1. 33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth Books of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver. 24. In the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster, by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion. It has been suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.] [Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver. 25. Tityus was a giant, the son of Jupiter and Elara. Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.] [Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver. 27. He was the son of Titan and Terra, and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning, and thrown beneath Mount Ætna. See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii. Ep.ii. 1.11.] [Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver. 28. He evidently alludes to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have imagined.] [Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver. 29. Æolus gave Ulysses favourable wind sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to Ithaca. See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 223] [Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver. 32. He calls Philomela the daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been the first king of Athens. Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver. 33. He alludes to the transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.] [Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver. 35. He alludes to the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus. See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver. 37. Reference is made to the transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled amber. See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 364.] [Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver. 38. He alludes to the ships of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea Nymphs.] [Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver. 39. Reference is made to the revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have hidden his face.] [Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver. 40. Amphion is said to have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.] [Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver. 2. Marcus Furius Camillus, the Roman general, took the city of Falisci.] [Footnote 665: The covered paths.--Ver. 12. The pipers, or flute players, led the procession, while the ground was covered with carpets or tapestry.] [Footnote 666: Snow-white heifers.--Ver. 14. Pliny the Elder, in his Second Book, says, 'The river Clitumnus, in the state of Falisci, makes those cattle white that drink of its waters.'] [Footnote 667: In the lofty woods.--Ver. 20. It is not known to what occasion this refers. Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her; and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in Egypt and Libya. Perhaps the former occasion is here referred to.] [Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver. 21. This is similar to the alleged origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday. The Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors, the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.] [Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver. 24. As 'vestis' was a general name for a covering of any kind, it may refer to the carpets which appear to be mentioned in the twelfth line, or it may mean, that the youths and damsels threw their own garments in the path of the procession.] [Footnote 670: After the Grecian manner.--Ver. 27. Falisci was said to have been a Grecian colony.] [Footnote 671: Hold religious silence.--Ver. 29.

'Favere linguis' seems here to mean, 'to keep religious silence as to the general meaning of the term, see the Fasti, Book i. 1. 71.] [Footnote 672: Halesus.--Ver. 33. Halesus is said to have been the son of Agamemnon, by a concubine. Alarmed at the tragic death of his father, and of the murderers, Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, he fled to Italy, where he founded the city of Phalesus, which title, with the addition of one letter, was given to it after his name. Phalesus afterwards became corrupted, to 'Faliscus,' or 'Falisci.'] [Footnote 673: One side and the other.--Ver. 32. For the 'torus exterior' and 'interior,' and the construction of the beds of the ancients, see the Note to the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 659. Forced to love.--Ver. 39. This passage seems to be hopelessly corrupt.] [Footnote 674: Turning-place is grazed.--Ver. 2. On rounding the 'meta' in the chariot race, from which the present figure is derived, see the Note to the 69th line of the Second Elegy of this Book.] [Footnote 675: Heir to my rank.--Ver. 5. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 112, where he enlarges upon the rank and circumstances of his family.] [Footnote 676: To glorious arms.--Ver. 9. He alludes to the Social war which was commenced in the year of the City 659, by the Marsi, the Peligni, and the Picentes, for the purpose of obtaining equal rights and privileges with the Roman citizens. He calls them 'arma honesta,' because wielded in defence of their liberties.] [Footnote 677: Rome dreaded.--Ver. 10. The Romans were so alarmed, that they vowed to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, if their arms should prove successful.] [Footnote 678: Amathusian parent.--Ver. 15. Venus was worshipped especially at Amathus, a city of Cyprus; it is mentioned by Ovid as abounding in metals. See the Metamorphoses, Book x. 1. 220 and 531, B. III.] [Footnote 679: The homed.--Ver. 17. In addition to the reasons already mentioned for Bacchus being represented as horned, it is said, by some, that it arose from the fact, of wine being drunk from horns in the early ages. It has been suggested, that it had a figurative meaning, and implied the violence of those who are overtaken with wine.] [Footnote 680: Lyæus.--Ver. 17. For the meaning of the word Lyæus, see the Metamorphoses, Book iv. 1. 11, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 681: My sportive.--Ver. 19. Genialis; the Genii were the Deities of pure, unadorned nature. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 58, and the Note to the passage.

They sat on the coolest corner in Port Said, their table commanding both the cross-way of Chareh Sultan el Osman, and the short, glaring vista of desert dust and starved young acacias which led to the black hulks of shipping in the Canal. From the Bar la Poste came orchestral strains--\"Ai nostri monti\"--performed by a piano indoors and two violins on the pavement. The sounds contended with a thin, scattered strumming of cafe mandolins, the tinkle of glasses, the steady click of dominoes and backgammon; then were drowned in the harsh chatter of Arab coolies who, all grimed as black as Nubians, and shouldering spear-headed shovels, tramped inland, their long tunics stiff with coal-dust, like a band of chain-mailed Crusaders lately caught in a hurricane of powdered charcoal. Athwart them, Parisian gowns floated past on stout Italian forms; hulking third-class Australians, in shirtsleeves, slouched along toward their mail-boat, hugging whiskey bottles, baskets of oranges, baskets of dates; British soldiers, khaki-clad for India, raced galloping donkeys through the crowded and dusty street. It was mail-day, and gayety flowed among the tables, under the thin acacias, on a high tide of Amer Picon. Through the inky files of the coaling-coolies burst an alien and bewildered figure. He passed unnoticed, except by the filthy little Arab bootblacks who swarmed about him, trotting, capering, yelping cheerfully: \"Mista Ferguson!--polish, finish!--can-can--see nice Frencha girl--Mista McKenzie, Scotcha fella from Dublin--smotta picture--polish, finish!\"--undertoned by a squabbling chorus. But presently, studying his face, they cried in a loud voice, \"Nix! Alles!\" and left him, as one not desiring polish. \"German, that chap,\" drawled the captain of the Tsuen-Chau, lazily, noticing the uncertain military walk of the young man's clumsy legs, his uncouth clothes, his pale visage winged by blushing ears of coral pink. \"The Eitel's in, then,\" replied Cesare. And they let the young Teuton vanish in the vision of mixed lives. Down the lane of music and chatter and drink he passed slowly, like a man just wakened,--assailed by Oriental noise and smells, jostled by the races of all latitudes and longitudes, surrounded and solitary, unheeded and self-conscious. With a villager's awkwardness among crowds, he made his way to a German shipping-office. \"Dispatches for Rudolph Hackh?\" he inquired, twisting up his blond moustache, and trying to look insolent and peremptory, like an employer of men. \"There are none, sir,\" answered an amiable clerk, not at all impressed. Abashed once more in the polyglot street, still daunted by his first plunge into the foreign and the strange, he retraced his path, threading shyly toward the Quai Francois Joseph. He slipped through the barrier gate, signaled clumsily to a boatman, crawled under the drunken little awning of the dinghy, and steered a landsman's course along", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-763eb7a8c18113dee91f1409786d898e", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "of men. \"There are none, sir,\" answered an amiable clerk, not at all impressed. Abashed once more in the polyglot street, still daunted by his first plunge into the foreign and the strange, he retraced his path, threading shyly toward the Quai Francois Joseph. He slipped through the barrier gate, signaled clumsily to a boatman, crawled under the drunken little awning of the dinghy, and steered a landsman's course along the shining Canal toward the black wall of a German mail-boat. Cramping the Arab's oar along the iron side, he bumped the landing-stage. Safe on deck, he became in a moment stiff and haughty, greeting a fellow passenger here and there with a half-military salute. All afternoon he sat or walked alone, unapproachable, eyeing with a fierce and gloomy stare the squalid front of wooden houses on the African side, the gray desert glare of Asia, the pale blue ribbon of the great Canal stretching southward into the unknown. He composed melancholy German verses in a note-book. He recalled famous exiles--Camoens, Napoleon, Byron--and essayed to copy something of all three in his attitude. He cherished the thought that he, clerk at twenty-one, was now agent at twenty-two, and traveling toward a house with servants, off there beyond the turn of the Canal, beyond the curve of the globe. But for all this, Rudolph Hackh felt young, homesick, timid of the future, and already oppressed with the distance, the age, the manifold, placid mystery of China. Toward that mystery, meanwhile, the ship began to creep. Behind her, houses, multi- funnels, scrubby trees, slowly swung to blot out the glowing Mediterranean and the western hemisphere. Gray desert banks closed in upon her strictly, slid gently astern, drawing with them to the vanishing-point the bright lane of traversed water. She gained the Bitter Lakes; and the red conical buoys, like beads a-stringing, slipped on and added to the two converging dotted lines. \"Good-by to the West!\" thought Rudolph. As he mourned sentimentally at this lengthening tally of their departure, and tried to quote appropriate farewells, he was deeply touched and pleased by the sadness of his emotions. \"Now what does Byron say?\" The sombre glow of romantic sentiment faded, however, with the sunset. That evening, as the ship glided from ruby coal to ruby coal of the gares, following at a steady six knots the theatric glare of her search-light along arsenically green cardboard banks, Rudolph paced the deck in a mood much simpler and more honest. In vain he tried the half-baked philosophy of youth. It gave no comfort; and watching the clear desert stars of two mysterious continents, he fell prey to the unbounded and unintelligible complexity of man's world. His own career seemed no more dubious than trivial. Succeeding days only strengthened this mood. The Red Sea passed in a dream of homesickness, intolerable heat, of a pale blue surface stretched before aching eyes, and paler strips of pink and gray coast, faint and distant. Like dreams, too, passed Aden and Colombo; and then, suddenly, he woke to the most acute interest. He had ignored his mess-mates at their second-class table; but when the new passengers from Colombo came to dinner, he heard behind him the swish of stiff skirts, felt some one brush his shoulder, and saw, sliding into the next revolving chair, the vision of a lady in white. \"_Mahlzeit_\" she murmured dutifully. But the voice was not German. Rudolph heard her subside with little flouncings, and felt his ears grow warm and red. Delighted, embarrassed, he at last took sufficient courage to steal side-glances. The first showed her to be young, fair-haired, and smartly attired in the plainest and coolest of white; the second, not so young, but very charming, with a demure downcast look, and a deft control of her spoon that, to Rudolph's eyes, was splendidly fastidious; at the third, he was shocked to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance, from large, dark-blue eyes, not devoid of amusement. \"She laughs at me!\" fumed the young man, inwardly. He was angry, conscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ears, vexed at his own boldness. \"I have been offensive. She laughs at me.\" He generalized from long inexperience of a subject to which he had given acutely interested thought: \"They always do.\" Anger did not prevent him, however, from noting that his neighbor traveled alone, that she must be an Englishwoman, and yet that she diffused, somehow, an aura of the Far East and of romance. He shot many a look toward her deck-chair that evening, and when she had gone below, strategically bought a cigar, sat down in the chair to light it, and by a carefully shielded match contrived to read the tag that fluttered on the arm: \"B. Forrester, Hongkong.\" Afterward he remembered that by early daylight he might have read it for nothing; and so, for economic penance, smoked to the bitter end, finding the cigar disagreeable but manly. At all events, homesickness had vanished in a curious impatience for the morrow. Miss Forrester: he would sit beside Miss Forrester at table.

At all events, homesickness had vanished in a curious impatience for the morrow. Miss Forrester: he would sit beside Miss Forrester at table. If only they both were traveling first-class!--then she might be a great lady. To be enamored of a countess, now--A cigar, after all, was the proper companion of bold thoughts. At breakfast, recalling her amusement, he remained silent and wooden. At tiffin his heart leaped. \"You speak English, I'm sure, don't you?\" Miss Forrester was saying, in a pleasant, rather drawling voice. Her eyes were quite serious now, and indeed friendly. Confusion seized him. \"I have less English to amuse myself with the ladies,\" he answered wildly. Next moment, however, he regained that painful mastery of the tongue which had won his promotion as agent, and stammered: \"Pardon. I would mean, I speak so badly as not to entertain her.\" \"Indeed, you speak very nicely,\" she rejoined, with such a smile as no woman had ever troubled to bestow on him. \"That will be so pleasant, for my German is shocking.\" Dazed by the compliment, by her manner of taking for granted that future conversation which had seemed too good to come true, but above all by her arch, provoking smile, Rudolph sat with his head in a whirl, feeling that the wide eyes of all the second-cabiners were penetrating the tumultuous secret of his breast. Again his English deserted, and left him stammering. But Miss Forrester chatted steadily, appeared to understand murmurs which he himself found obscure, and so restored his confidence that before tiffin was over he talked no less gayly, his honest face alight and glowing. She taught him the names of the strange fruits before them; but though listening and questioning eagerly, he could not afterward have told loquat from pumelo, or custard-apple from papaya. Nor could this young man, of methodical habits, ever have told how long their voyage lasted. It passed, unreal and timeless, in a glorious mist, a delighted fever: the background a blur of glossy white bulkheads and iron rails, awnings that fluttered in the warm, languorous winds, an infinite tropic ocean poignantly blue; the foreground, Miss Forrester. Her white figure, trim and dashing; her round blue eyes, filled with coy wonder, the arch innocence of a spoiled child; her pale, smooth cheeks, rather plump, but coming oddly and enticingly to a point at the mouth and tilted chin; her lips, somewhat too full, too red, but quick and whimsical: he saw these all, and these only, in a bright focus, listening meanwhile to a voice by turns languid and lively, with now and then a curious liquid softness, perhaps insincere, yet dangerously pleasant. Questioning, hinting, she played at motherly age and wisdom. As for him, he never before knew how well he could talk, or how engrossing his sober life, both in his native village on the Baltic and afterward in Bremen, could prove to either himself or a stranger. Yet he was not such a fool, he reflected, as to tell everything. So far from trading confidences, she had told him only that she was bound straight on to Hongkong; that curiosity alone had led her to travel second-class, \"for the delightful change, you know, from all such formality\"; and that she was \"really more French than English.\" Her reticence had the charm of an incognito; and taking this leaf from her book, he gave himself out as a large, vaguely important person journeying on a large, vague errand. \"But you are a griffin?\" she had said, as they sat together at tea. \"Pardon?\" he ventured, wary and alarmed, wondering whether he could claim this unknown term as in character with his part. \"I mean,\" Miss Forrester explained, smiling, \"it is your first visit to the Far East?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he replied eagerly, blushing. He would have given worlds to say, \"No.\" \"Griffins are such nice little monsters,\" she purred. \"I like them.\" Sometimes at night, waked by the snores of a fat Prussian in the upper berth, he lay staring into the dark, while the ship throbbed in unison with his excited thoughts. He was amazed at his happy recklessness. He would never see her again; he was hurrying toward lonely and uncertain shores; yet this brief voyage outvalued the rest of his life. In time, they had left Penang,--another unheeded background for her arch, innocent, appealing face,--and forged down the Strait of Malacca in a flood of nebulous moonlight. It was the last night out from Singapore. That veiled brightness, as they leaned on the rail, showed her brown hair fluttering dimly, her face pale, half real, half magical, her eyes dark and undefined pools of mystery. It was late; they had been silent for a long time; and Rudolph felt that something beyond the territory of words remained to be said, and that the one brilliant epoch of his life now drew madly to a close. \"What do you think of it all?\" the woman asked suddenly, gravely, as though they had been isolated together in the deep spaces of the same thought. \"I do not yet--Of what?\" rejoined Rudolph, at a loss. \"Of all this.\" She waved an eloquent little gesture toward the azure-lighted gulf. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Of the world?\" \"Yes,\" she answered slowly. \"The world.

Life.\" Her tone, subdued and musical, conveyed in the mere words their full enigma and full meaning. \"All this that we see.\" \"Who can tell?\" He took her seriously, and ransacked all his store of second-hand philosophy for a worthy answer,--a musty store, dead and pedantic, after the thrilling spirit of her words. \"Why, I think--it is--is it not all now the sense-manifest substance of our duty? Pardon. I am obscure. '_Das versinnlichte Material unserer Pflicht_' No?\" Her clear laughter startled him. \"Oh, how moral!\" she cried. \"What a highly moral little griffin!\" She laughed again (but this time it was like the splash of water in a deep well), and turned toward him that curiously tilted point of chin and mouth, her eyes shadowy and mocking. She looked young again,--the spirit of youth, of knowledge, of wonderful brightness and unbelief. \"Must we take it so very, very hard?\" she coaxed. \"Isn't it just a place to be happy in?\" As through a tumult he heard, and recognized the wisdom of the ages. \"Because,\" she added, \"it lasts such a little while--\" On the rail their hands suddenly touched. He was aware of nothing but the nearness and pallor of her face, the darkness of her eyes shining up at him. All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one instant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination. Footsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called jocosely:-- \"Good efening!\" The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air. \"You see at the phosphor, not?\" Even as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a touch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most friendly smile. The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat physician continued:-- \"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs. Forrester?\" Had the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a minor shipwreck. Mrs. Forrester? why, then--When the doctor, after ponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a face of tragedy. \"Was that true?\" he demanded grimly. \"Was what true?\" she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer deceived, but angered. \"What the doctor said.\" Rudolph's voice trembled. \"The tittle--the title he gave you.\" \"Why, of course,\" she laughed. \"And you did not tell me!\" he began, with scorn. \"Don't be foolish,\" she cut in. From beneath her skirt the toe of a small white shoe tapped the deck angrily. Of a sudden she laughed, and raised a tantalizing face, merry, candid, and inscrutable. \"Why, you never asked me, and--and of course I thought you were saying it all along. You have such a dear, funny way of pronouncing, you know.\" He hesitated, almost believing; then, with a desperate gesture, wheeled and marched resolutely aft. That night it was no Prussian snores which kept him awake and wretched. \"Everything is finished,\" he thought abysmally. He lay overthrown, aching, crushed, as though pinned under the fallen walls of his youth. At breakfast-time, the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowds of brown and yellow men, scarfed, swathed, and turbaned in riotous colors, worked quarreling with harsh cries, in unspeakable interweaving uproar. The air, hot and steamy, smelled of strange earth. As Rudolph followed a Malay porter toward the gang-plank, he was painfully aware that Mrs. Forrester had turned from the rail and stood waiting in his path. \"Without saying good-by?\" she reproached him. The injured wonder in her eyes he thought a little overdone. \"Good-by.\" He could not halt, but, raising his cap stiffly, managed to add, \"A pleasant voyage,\" and passed on, feeling as though she had murdered something. He found himself jogging in a rickshaw, while equatorial rain beat like down-pouring bullets on the tarpaulin hood, and sluiced the Chinaman's oily yellow back. Over the heavy-muscled shoulders he caught glimpses of sullen green foliage, ponderous and drooping; of half-naked barbarians that squatted in the shallow caverns of shops; innumerable faces, black, yellow, white, and brown, whirling past, beneath other tarpaulin hoods, or at carriage windows, or shielded by enormous dripping wicker hats, or bared to the pelting rain. Curious odors greeted him, as of sour vegetables and of unknown rank substances burning. He stared like a visionary at the streaming multitude of alien shapes.

Curious odors greeted him, as of sour vegetables and of unknown rank substances burning. He stared like a visionary at the streaming multitude of alien shapes. The coolie swerved, stopped, tilted his shafts to the ground. Rudolph entered a sombre, mouldy office, where the darkness rang with tiny silver bells. Pig-tailed men in skull-caps, their faces calm as polished ivory, were counting dollars endlessly over flying finger-tips. One of these men paused long enough to give him a sealed dispatch,--the message to which the ocean-bed, the Midgard ooze, had thrilled beneath his tardy keel. \"Zimmerman recalled,\" the interpretation ran; \"take his station; proceed at once.\" He knew the port only as forlorn and insignificant. It did not matter. One consolation remained: he would never see her again. CHAPTER II THE PIED PIPER A gray smudge trailing northward showed where the Fa-Hien--Scottish Oriental, sixteen hundred tons--was disappearing from the pale expanse of ocean. The sampan drifted landward imperceptibly, seeming, with nut-brown sail unstirred, to remain where the impatient steamer had met it, dropped a solitary passenger overside, and cast him loose upon the breadth of the antipodes. Rare and far, the sails of junks patched the horizon with umber polygons. Rudolph, sitting among his boxes in the sampan, viewed by turns this desolate void astern and the more desolate sweep of coast ahead. His matting sail divided the shining bronze outpour of an invisible river, divided a low brown shore beyond, and above these, the strips of some higher desert country that shone like snowdrifts, or like sifted ashes from which the hills rose black and charred. Their savage, winter-blasted look, in the clear light of an almost vernal morning, made the land seem fabulous. Yet here in reality, thought Rudolph, as he floated toward that hoary kingdom,--here at last, facing a lonely sea, reared the lifeless, inhospitable shore, the sullen margin of China. The slow creaking of the spliced oar, swung in its lashing by a half-naked yellow man, his incomprehensible chatter with some fellow boatman hidden in the bows, were sounds lost in a drowsy silence, rhythms lost in a wide inertia. Time itself seemed stationary. Rudolph nodded, slept, and waking, found the afternoon sped, the hills gone, and his clumsy, time-worn craft stealing close under a muddy bank topped with brown weeds and grass. They had left behind the silted roadstead, and now, gliding on a gentle flood, entered the river-mouth. Here and there, against the saffron tide, or under banks quaggy as melting chocolate, stooped a naked fisherman, who--swarthy as his background but for a loin-band of yellow flesh--shone wet and glistening while he stirred a dip-net through the liquid mud. Faint in the distance harsh cries sounded now and then, and the soft popping of small-arms,--tiny revolts in the reign of a stillness aged and formidable. Crumbling walls and squat ruins, black and green-patched with mould--old towers of defense against pirates--guarded from either bank the turns of the river. In one reach, a \"war-junk,\" her sails furled, lay at anchor, the red and white eyes staring fish-like from her black prow: a silly monster, the painted tompions of her wooden cannon aiming drunkenly askew, her crew's wash fluttering peacefully in a line of blue dungaree. Beyond the next turn, a fowling-piece cracked sharply, close at hand; something splashed, and the ruffled body of a snipe bobbed in the bronze flood alongside. \"Hang it!\" complained a voice, loudly. \"The beggar was too--Hallo! Oh, I say, Gilly! Gilly, ahoy! Pick us up, there's a good chap! The bird first, will you, and then me.\" A tall young man in brown holland and a battered _terai_ stood above on the grassy brink. \"Oh, beg pardon,\" he continued. \"Took you for old Gilly, you know.\" He snapped the empty shells from his gun, and blew into the breech, before adding, \"Would _you_ mind, then? That is, if you're bound up for Stink-Chau. It's a beastly long tramp, and I've been shooting all afternoon.\" Followed by three coolies who popped out of the grass with game-bags, the young stranger descended, hopped nimbly from tussock to gunwale, and perched there to wash his boots in the river. \"Might have known you weren't old Gilly,\" he said over his shoulder. \"Wutzler said the Fa-Hien lay off signaling for sampan before breakfast. Going to stay long?\" \"I am agent,\" answered Rudolph, with a touch of pride, \"for Fliegelman and Sons.\" \"Oh?\" drawled the hunter, lazily. He swung his legs inboard, faced about, and studied Rudolph with embarrassing frankness. He was a long-limbed young Englishman, whose cynical gray eyes, and thin face tinged rather sallow and Oriental, bespoke a reckless good humor. \"Life sentence, eh? Then your name's--what is it again?--Hackh, isn't it? Heywood's mine. So you take Zimmerman's place. He's off already, and good riddance. He _was_ a bounder!--Charming spot you've come to! I daresay if your Fliegelmans opened a hong in hell, you might possibly get a worse station.\" Without change", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-dd506e2b4ab4403262e3cf611653609b", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "thin face tinged rather sallow and Oriental, bespoke a reckless good humor. \"Life sentence, eh?

I daresay if your Fliegelmans opened a hong in hell, you might possibly get a worse station.\" Without change of manner, he uttered a few gabbling, barbaric words. A coolie knelt, and with a rag began to clean the boots, which, from the expression of young Mr. Heywood's face, were more interesting than the arrival of a new manager from Germany. \"It will be dark before we're in,\" he said. \"My place for the night, of course, and let your predecessor's leavings stand over till daylight. After dinner we'll go to the club. Dinner! Chicken and rice, chicken and rice! Better like it, though, for you'll eat nothing else, term of your life.\" \"You are very kind,\" began Rudolph; but this bewildering off-hand youngster cut him short, with a laugh:-- \"No fear, you'll pay me! Your firm supplies unlimited liquor. Much good that ever did us, with old Zimmerman.\" The sampan now slipped rapidly on the full flood, up a narrow channel that the setting of the sun had turned, as at a blow, from copper to indigo. The shores passed, more and more obscure against a fading light. A star or two already shone faint in the lower spaces. A second war-junk loomed above them, with a ruddy fire in the stern lighting a glimpse of squat forms and yellow goblin faces. \"It is very curious,\" said Rudolph, trying polite conversation, \"how they paint so the eyes on their jonks.\" \"No eyes, no can see; no can see, no can walkee,\" chanted Heywood in careless formula. \"I say,\" he complained suddenly, \"you're not going to 'study the people,' and all that rot? We're already fed up with missionaries. Their cant, I mean; no allusion to cannibalism.\" He lighted a cigarette. After the blinding flare of the match, night seemed to have fallen instantaneously. As their boat crept on to the slow creaking sweep, both maintained silence, Rudolph rebuked and lonely, Heywood supine beneath a comfortable winking spark. \"What I mean is,\" drawled the hunter, \"we need all the good fellows we can get. Bring any new songs out? Oh, I forgot, you're a German, too.--A sweet little colony! Gilly's the only gentleman in the whole half-dozen of us, and Heaven knows he's not up to much.--Ah, we're in. On our right, fellow sufferers, we see the blooming Village of Stinks.\" He had risen in the gloom. Beyond his shadow a few feeble lights burned low and scattered along the bank. Strange cries arose, the bumping of sampans, the mournful caterwauling of a stringed instrument. \"The native town's a bit above,\" he continued. \"We herd together here on the edge. No concession, no bund, nothing.\" Their sampan grounded softly in malodorous ooze. Each mounting the bare shoulders of a coolie, the two Europeans rode precariously to shore. \"My boys will fetch your boxes,\" called Heywood. \"Come on.\" The path, sometimes marshy, sometimes hard-packed clay or stone flags deeply littered, led them a winding course in the night. Now and then shapes met them and pattered past in single file, furtive and sinister. At last, where a wall loomed white, Heywood stopped, and, kicking at a wooden gate, gave a sing-song cry. With rattling weights, the door swung open, and closed behind them heavily. A kind of empty garden, a bare little inclosure, shone dimly in the light that streamed from a low, thick-set veranda at the farther end. Dogs flew at them, barking outrageously. \"Down, Chang! Down, Chutney!\" cried their master. \"Be quiet, Flounce, you fool!\" On the stone floor of the house, they leaped upon him, two red chows and a fox-terrier bitch, knocking each other over in their joy. \"Olo she-dog he catchee plenty lats,\" piped a little Chinaman, who shuffled out from a side-room where lamplight showed an office desk. \"Too-day catchee. Plenty lats. No can.\" \"My compradore, Ah Pat,\" said Heywood to Rudolph. \"Ah Pat, my friend he b'long number one Flickleman, boss man.\" The withered little creature bobbed in his blue robe, grinning at the introduction. \"You welly high-tone man,\" he murmured amiably. \"Catchee goo' plice.\" \"All the same, I don't half like it,\" was Heywood's comment later. He had led his guest upstairs into a bare white-washed room, furnished in wicker. Open windows admitted the damp sea breeze and a smell, like foul gun-barrels, from the river marshes. \"Where should all the rats be coming from?\" He frowned, meditating on what Rudolph thought a trifle. Above the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly, close-cropped and vigorous. \"Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one sherry-bitters, one bamboo!\" \"To our better acquaintance,\" said Rudolph, as they raised their glasses. \"What?

Above the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly, close-cropped and vigorous. \"Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one sherry-bitters, one bamboo!\" \"To our better acquaintance,\" said Rudolph, as they raised their glasses. \"What? Oh, yes, thanks,\" the other laughed. \"Any one would know you for a griffin here, Mr. Hackh. You've not forgotten your manners yet.\" When they had sat down to dinner in another white-washed room, and had undertaken the promised rice and chicken, he laughed again, somewhat bitterly. \"Better acquaintance--no fear! You'll be so well acquainted with us all that you'll wish you never clapped eyes on us.\" He drained his whiskey and soda, signaled for more, and added: \"Were you ever cooped up, yachting, with a chap you detested? That's the feeling you come to have.--Here, stand by. You're drinking nothing.\" Rudolph protested. Politeness had so far conquered habit, that he felt uncommonly flushed, genial, and giddy. \"That,\" urged Heywood, tapping the bottle, \"that's our only amusement. You'll see. One good thing we can get is the liquor. 'Nisi damnose bibimus,'--forget how it runs: 'Drink hearty, or you'll die without getting your revenge,'\" \"You are then a university's-man?\" cried Rudolph, with enthusiasm. The other nodded gloomily. On the instant his face had fallen as impassive as that of the Chinese boy who stood behind his chair, straight, rigid, like a waxen image of Gravity in a blue gown.--\"Yes, of sorts. Young fool. Scrapes. Debt. Out to Orient. Same old story. More debt. Trust the firm to encourage that! Debt and debt and debt. Tied up safe. Transfer. Finish! Never go Home.\"--He rose with a laugh and an impatient gesture.--\"Come on. Might as well take in the club as to sit here talking rot.\" Outside the gate of the compound, coolies crouching round a lantern sprang upright and whipped a pair of sedan-chairs into position. Heywood, his feet elevated comfortably over the poles, swung in the lead; Rudolph followed, bobbing in the springy rhythm of the long bamboos. The lanterns danced before them down an open road, past a few blank walls and dark buildings, and soon halted before a whitened front, where light gleamed from the upper story. \"Mind the stairs,\" called Heywood. \"Narrow and beastly dark.\" As they stumbled up the steep flight, Rudolph heard the click of billiard balls. A pair of hanging lamps lighted the room into which he rose,--a low, gloomy loft, devoid of comfort. At the nearer table, a weazened little man bent eagerly over a pictorial paper; at the farther, chalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a gray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat, smart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a glance the most striking figure in the room. A little Chinese imp in white, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of preternatural cunning. \"Mr. Wutzler,\" said Heywood. The weazened reader rose in a nervous flutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful agony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly took refuge in his tattered _Graphic_. The players, however, advanced in a more friendly fashion. The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not catch, shook his hand heartily. \"Mr. Hackh is a welcome addition.\" He spoke with deliberate courtesy. Something in his voice, the tired look in his frank blue eyes and serious face, at once engaged respect. \"For our sakes,\" he continued, \"we're glad to see you here. I am sure Doctor Chantel will agree with me.\" \"Ah, indeed,\" said the man in military blue, with a courtier's bow. Both air and accent were French. \"Most welcome.\" \"Let's all have a drink,\" cried Heywood. Despite his many glasses at dinner, he spoke with the alacrity of a new idea. \"O Boy, whiskey _Ho-lan suey, fai di_!\" Away bounded the boy marker like a tennis-ball. \"Hello, Wutzler's off already!\"--The little old reader had quietly disappeared, leaving them a vacant table.--\"Isn't he weird?\" laughed Heywood, as they sat down. \"Comes and goes like a ghost.\" \"It is his Chinese wife,\" declared Chantel, preening his moustache. \"He is always ashame to meet the new persons.\" \"Poor old chap,\" said Heywood. \"I know--feels himself an outcast and all that. Humph! With us! Quite unnecessary.\"--The Chinese page, quick, solemn, and noiseless, glided round the table with his tray.--\"Ah, you young devil! You're another weird one, you atom. See those bead eyes watching us, eh? A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see you go off in a flash of fire. If you don't poison us all first.--Well, here's fortune!\" \"Your health, Mr. Hackh,\" amended the other Englishman. As they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a stifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four faced about, and listened intently", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9f8de23f34a0e649239c33f671c88fb6", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "bead eyes watching us, eh? A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see you go off in a flash of fire. If you don't poison us all first.--Well, here's fortune!\" \"Your health, Mr. Hackh,\" amended the other Englishman. As they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a stifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four faced about, and listened intently. \"Kom down,\" called a hesitating voice, \"kom down and look-see.\" They sprang to the stairs, and clattered downward. Dim radiance flooded the landing, from the street door. Outside, a smoky lantern on the ground revealed the lower levels. In the wide sector of light stood Wutzler, shrinking and apologetic, like a man caught in a fault, his wrinkled face eloquent of fear, his gesture eloquent of excuse. Round him, as round a conjurer, scores of little shadowy things moved in a huddling dance, fitfully hopping like sparrows over spilt grain. Where the light fell brightest these became plainer, their eyes shone in jeweled points of color. \"By Jove, Gilly, they are rats!\" said Heywood, in a voice curiously forced and matter-of-fact. \"Flounce killed several this afternoon, so my--\" No one heeded him; all stared. The rats, like beings of incantation, stole about with an absence of fear, a disregard of man's presence, that was odious and alarming. \"Earthquake?\" The elder Englishman spoke as though afraid of disturbing some one. The French doctor shook his head. \"No,\" he answered in the same tone. \"Look.\" The rats, in all their weaving confusion, displayed one common impulse. They sprang upward continually, with short, agonized leaps, like drowning creatures struggling to keep afloat above some invisible flood. The action, repeated multitudinously into the obscure background, exaggerated in the foreground by magnified shadows tossing and falling on the white walls, suggested the influence of some evil stratum, some vapor subtle and diabolic, crawling poisonously along the ground. Heywood stamped angrily, without effect. Wutzler stood abject, a magician impotent against his swarm of familiars. Gradually the rats, silent and leaping, passed away into the darkness, as though they heard the summons of a Pied Piper. \"It doesn't attack Europeans.\" Heywood still used that curious inflection. \"Then my brother Julien is still alive,\" retorted Doctor Chantel, bitterly. \"What do you think, Gilly?\" persisted Heywood. His compatriot nodded in a meaningless way. \"The doctor's right, of course,\" he answered. \"I wish my wife weren't coming back.\" \"Dey are a remember,\" ventured Wutzler, timidly. \"A warnung.\" The others, as though it had been a point of custom, ignored him. All stared down, musing, at the vacant stones. \"Then the concert's off to-morrow night,\" mocked Heywood, with an unpleasant laugh. \"On the contrary.\" Gilly caught him up, prompt and decided. \"We shall need all possible amusements; also to meet and plan our campaign. Meantime,--what do you say, Doctor?--chloride of lime in pots?\" \"That, evidently,\" smiled the handsome man. \"Yes, and charcoal burnt in braziers, perhaps, as Pere Fenouil advises. Fumigate.\"--Satirical and debonair, he shrugged his shoulders.--\"What use, among these thousands of yellow pigs?\" \"I wish she weren't coming,\" repeated Gilly. Rudolph, left outside this conference, could bear the uncertainty no longer. \"I am a new arrival,\" he confided to his young host. \"I do not understand. What is it?\" \"The plague, old chap,\" replied Heywood, curtly. \"These playful little animals get first notice. You're not the only arrival to-night.\" CHAPTER III UNDER FIRE The desert was sometimes Gobi, sometimes Sahara, but always an infinite stretch of sand that floated up and up in a stifling layer, like the tide. Rudolph, desperately choked, continued leaping upward against an insufferable power of gravity, or straining to run against the force of paralysis. The desert rang with phantom voices,--Chinese voices that mocked him, chanting of pestilence, intoning abhorrently in French. He woke to find a knot of bed-clothes smothering him. To his first unspeakable relief succeeded the astonishment of hearing the voices continue in shrill chorus, the tones Chinese, the words, in louder fragments, unmistakably French. They sounded close at hand, discordant matins sung by a mob of angry children. Once or twice a weary, fretful voice scolded feebly: \"Un-peu-de-s'lence! Un-peu-de-s'lence!\" Rudolph rose to peep through the heavy jalousies, but saw nothing more than sullen daylight, a flood of vertical rain, and thin rivulets coursing down a tiled roof below. The morning was dismally cold. \"Jolivet's kids wake you?\" Heywood, in a blue kimono, nodded from the doorway. \"Public nuisance, that school. Quite needless, too.

You'll find the dipper more handy.--How did you ever manage? One leg at a time?\" Echoes of glee followed his disappearance. Rudolph, blushing, prepared to descend into the gloomy vault of ablution. Charcoal fumes, however, and the glow of a brazier on the dark floor below, not only revived all his old terror, but at the stair-head halted him with a new. \"Is the water safe?\" he called. Heywood answered impatiently from his bedroom. \"Nothing safe in this world, Mr. Hackh. User's risk.\" An inaudible mutter ended with, \"Keep clean, anyway.\" At breakfast, though the acrid smoke was an enveloping reminder, he made the only reference to their situation. \"Rain at last: too late, though, to flush out the gutters. We needed it a month ago.--I say, Hackh, if you don't mind, you might as well cheer up. From now on, it's pure heads and tails. We're all under fire together.\" Glancing out of window at the murky sky, he added thoughtfully, \"One excellent side to living without hope, maskee fashion: one isn't specially afraid. I'll take you to your office, and you can make a start. Nothing else to do, is there?\" Dripping bearers and shrouded chairs received them on the lower floor, carried them out into a chill rain that drummed overhead and splashed along the compound path in silver points. The sunken flags in the road formed a narrow aqueduct that wavered down a lane of mire. A few grotesque wretches, thatched about with bamboo matting, like bottles, or like rosebushes in winter, trotted past shouldering twin baskets. The smell of joss-sticks, fish, and sour betel, the subtle sweetness of opium, grew constantly stronger, blended with exhalations of ancient refuse, and (as the chairs jogged past the club, past filthy groups huddling about the well in a marketplace, and onward into the black yawn of the city gate) assailed the throat like a bad and lasting taste. Now, in the dusky street, pent narrowly by wet stone walls, night seemed to fall, while fresh waves of pungent odor overwhelmed and steeped the senses. Rudolph's chair jostled through hundreds and hundreds of Chinese, all alike in the darkness, who shuffled along before with switching queues, or flattened against the wall to stare, almost nose to nose, at the passing foreigner. With chairpoles backing into one shop or running ahead into another, with raucous cries from the coolies, he swung round countless corners, bewildered in a dark, leprous, nightmare bazaar. Overhead, a slit of cloudy sky showed rarely; for the most part, he swayed along indoors, beneath a dingy lattice roof. All points of the compass vanished; all streets remained alike,--the same endless vista of mystic characters, red, black, and gold, on narrow suspended tablets, under which flowed the same current of pig-tailed men in blue and dirty white. From every shop, the same yellow faces stared at him, the same elfin children caught his eye for a half-second to grin or grimace, the same shaven foreheads bent over microscopical tasks in the dark. At first, Rudolph thought the city loud and brawling; but resolving this impression to the hideous shouts of his coolies parting the crowd, he detected, below or through their noise, from all the long cross-corridors a wide and appalling silence. Gradually, too, small sounds relieved this: the hammering of brass-work, the steady rattle of a loom, or the sing-song call and mellow bell of some burdened hawker, bumping past, his swinging baskets filled with a pennyworth of trifles. But still the silence daunted Rudolph in this astounding vision, this masque of unreal life, of lost daylight, of annihilated direction, of placid turmoil and multifarious identity, made credible only by the permanence of nauseous smells. Somewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and heavy as a Gate of Dreams. And as by the anachronism of dreams there hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar placard--\"Fliegelman and Sons, Office.\" Heywood led the way, past two ducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished stiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by roof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god in his ebony and tinsel shrine. \"There,\" he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little pent-house, where another draughty lamp flickered on a European desk. \"Here's your cell. I'm off--call for you later. Good luck!\"--Wheeling in the doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--\"Caught! You may as well start in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'\" To his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might listen to the last of all earthly visitors. Peering through a kind of butler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates, like mystic automatons, nod", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwFwQlUE2cCAGAXigUkCkgggRwzk3/+mUmCsIIYREWlqDwBldZV+8SjyqpdtUofIPXW9omsiihnyEwyM/+cCVrPqsWusL56sd2tgFrrilp9oq2vtVpar3W/7yrQbKNt5QmN1kZzlLPA6W7tZTt9rdRwMRurFlDwDd/b7MXajaP093RElqNi1ZDa6T+jhAWnmqKp2gQJboU5pFEbh5aCuwdruHCmEU+Xw50OvgfE6AfaK3xOdJL4M+7x6UobV0bEEeewWy2oIUr/FbLmkHxcmQ/mWR7R82iXGqt2BAaVZdpeeTMSzW8FmsFaxZi+So0GknUH6GB34k30HDCKDJN51/yUUv3bwGG6nF4b/AegxLPBddgb2ybXCL6b3C7pjkjpIfyrr9Ze1DQJjeJdfLb8Q6KDItXlUoWr0P82f9M7Vg3HV1P1qJgcgh1zrYSzAgLKQW+Y1+AoFpG8B1/YMkHJYBfQP0sv+Aw7LtQ4zdpCZb30hcFuf5/MptMgj8nyXVhmbaZ3wylKF4wl8uhbbKmwtO1xaBeIilft+a4VVAeZTs9WTuEW5hbo1ZbRNwLZwOPogquZD9UMRSG3UU1KrfREHk7kkuXKM2m3g5FfodNoj727kdPnsR5+Kh1l/Aqr9pXDb+UYcEubhun2IVx3gKVmxPuHPgC6mEgGWgfsF4J9qbcVt2RSBoiDSgRjpTa707k87VFSRmCI9qXzfa7ZulTx2Cb41/P95O8BvwzUGO1TJUS6cbO/KThXbXQeVXoch82nTYupXPInq0uQ1TWc2NIjXk/4Sr0K5uhbaBItwLLFOrGTHuP7iRTJ7QnbhE651Il8RVgPU6mWHDmqrg5ssU7GH5Dh9kJxl2V4aLxSd+iEfKX1qrOAqXAMGsvwqcEi3ybrUCfljgWbSB+eecCgRcJkxwhXgbpZ6YN99qmUBxrY8YQdXmRYtl/uFp5p25EBLQosIrJsBle1XGrq9EYwBaCP8jAUdlL6WpsUusz34pXkO2IVmoAKLOdFg0Squ4TNSQ5iYusW/go/qT3ob8WGKMu8zWBBk6RHoCxwbYwBbeV4RzTssFxAy4RhRLq1H1/Plzi+h2uc95zNKranqClOeGD1BzOJSP28+gs10ygTbWh22xL5JHYRVUnz7d/xVOi7YJeeL/8Bj/A/2lr3P9XuOLJs/wJ7wH/kVtdTMdeX561DdkzX4vclB6PJZXAJJLX7ZCX1SkxSWrjpyli2zfkLMOMD9fl7t/pGSJlwbcK75sOBF+JKkqNnOGyQ9WXBjWKh9gbkCfel5egOfk1dhe3RJ5FXLEdpq50mvoEzaidLvyYOyF+oMfCgupN/D99h8rmvshVYLsxBA3BQCgudt/URWfUfhEJ8KVADM9AWexTYjpIbPY4xqAlUSaX7ol2r6N9lF9oPRkvV2NnoeLEIjfNtp05JF+kc+U7gNvfSe0ZO9hdoh7DRzH5SdV+WXzBR8BP4Fp9ER0V2a2HUQbAblukeaQGIBdtQP2Bhku16DKsUtzqIe3CrZAgWk0XOKSk9lgqyC71KTBA90n5Yg62kRkgqvYBeI4QR+5ke+rmaD06CL+k7fKepSZplT2XsKFaODhktl8FrlbNecsmJ+f4ObYV/hlKm9rOP0TTuY6sx8Jy7tjOJTIlv5xPhCvoxKOOTQxUmq/TKYuaHa436ebGV/JOr1jFHxhq7mMNtYY7lDZw9CrbSb8sX5CXwpdRre6JlokkqNCe0ZFGn5Qr6snVi+yrzbbzeFw5z1RJlCjqHPkfjyWx+oazbXc0lTEmIc/1I5LZk2p/bzgg5SgroZCLIWHKfcIJfDZ9qJmGsfEl9FhgZnED3yQ+UGiLUOCgu4m3cERCXQuAbA6uk9sRi59+opSBSaPKZmOneJ8Ij6hh6QS32peElzD4XxxhMD1tUKS0wkzbIXpDrr2H/wp2hC2mPbyw6wdxkCnAiaQ5bi33QPK2lW2xgvzbe5TdoxcEmtIWOFmhwUBuOKs0vHVVqGtElVAl1zbqwlz6OzSI3ET87vjl0gDyrDISOwyY2T83FzgTi9PLUYRaCG6flN4RBp3aKcRuLoQWrUy9J/dpksJmxyp/gg9zNlJf+z+R6+e9MmS+eD8qpahq9i5qCP2JrlCXonvKuGFTncTeS8uT69g3KYjgS9Ho/gqZApMRRBsprUtnxfC2aq8QJ52zVMf8E5foIAdcvtc7W74Bi7a4zSf8BbjNmSCfVfH8h6XXOs/2BNiqf+WPlTtXjigjgzAPlIt5AiMJk6xi0gkp0DsoNRpeRpWKk/4IItVtdJ+p6sToSDJMB+ljKpXMYUvjN3M2wKbuDfSCOeCzZlGvOdcjtmGjNiM8wZYH/EXnWTPcxBpc7JQMzVl2v9ATP1w3D29jJyARXEPkj59gr2YlSuFKDDw19b4tIdYN87Ln8obcSEQlOebVwyNXhMEMfXY2m0w+Zf2ujUt5g1cw70jXshLKbqlL6bIu1o9x63C1GOJ7wPFxKzyQQsU46nbxS/dwx05odnBK8LqRKF0gP4447wSc2bJTuy8ctr+119N3koY6h9WGw0Dme+ch3gNmmxaAMJj1ZtxK+DegG/xtZxfRTaTBbs5BL/Gb3DtSgNaK10lzlsvX/vDhoZQ=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-64f11361a750eadd8a4749bae2438fb6", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": ". I'm off--call for you later. Good luck!\"--Wheeling in the doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--\"Caught! You may as well start in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'\" To his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might listen to the last of all earthly visitors. Peering through a kind of butler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates, like mystic automatons, nodding and smoking by the doorway. Beyond them, across a darker square like a cavern-mouth, flitted the living phantoms of the street. It seemed a fit setting for his fears. \"I am lost,\" he thought; lost among goblins, marooned in the age of barbarism, shut in a labyrinth with a Black Death at once actual and mediaeval: he dared not think of Home, but flung his arms on the littered desk, and buried his face. On the tin pent-roof, the rain trampled inexorably. At last, mustering a shaky resolution, he set to work ransacking the tumbled papers. Happily, Zimmerman had left all in confusion. The very hopelessness of his accounts proved a relief. Working at high tension, Rudolph wrestled through disorder, mistakes, falsification; and little by little, as the sorted piles grew and his pen traveled faster, the old absorbing love of method and dispatch--the stay, the cordial flagon of troubled man--gave him strength to forget. At times, felt shoes scuffed the stone floor without, and high, scolding voices rose, exchanging unfathomable courtesy with his clerks. One after another, strange figures, plump and portly in their  robes, crossed his threshold, nodding their buttoned caps, clasping their hands hidden in voluminous sleeves. \"My 'long speakee my goo' flien',\" chanted each of these apparitions; and each, after a long, slow discourse that ended more darkly than it began, retired with fatuous nods and smirks of satisfaction, leaving Rudolph dismayed by a sense of cryptic negotiation in which he had been found wanting. Noon brought the only other interval, when two solemn \"boys\" stole in with curry and beer. Eat he could not in this lazaret, but sipped a little of the dark Kirin brew, and plunged again into his researches. Alone with his lamp and rustling papers, he fought through perplexities, now whispering, now silent, like a student rapt in some midnight fervor. \"What ho! Mustn't work this fashion!\" Heywood's voice woke him, sudden as a gust of sharp air. \"Makee finish!\" The summons was both welcome and unwelcome; for as their chairs jostled homeward through the reeking twilight, Rudolph felt the glow of work fade like the mockery of wine. The strange seizure returned,--exile, danger, incomprehensibility, settled down upon him, cold and steady as the rain. Tea, at Heywood's house, was followed by tobacco, tobacco by sherry, and this by a dinner from yesterday's game-bag. The two men said little, sitting dejected, as if by agreement. But when Heywood rose, he changed into gayety as a man slips on a jacket. \"Now, then, for the masked ball! I mean, we can't carry these long faces to the club, can we? Ladies' Night--what larks!\" He caught up his cap, with a grimace. \"The Lord loveth a cheerful liar. Come ahead!\" On the way, he craned from his chair to shout, in the darkness:-- \"I say! If you can do a turn of any sort, let the women have it. All the fun they get. Be an ass, like the rest of us. Maskee how silly! Mind you, it's all hands, these concerts!\" No music, but the click of ivory and murmur of voices came down the stairway of the club. At first glance, as Rudolph rose above the floor, the gloomy white loft seemed vacant as ever; at second glance, embarrassingly full of Europeans. Four strangers grounded their cues long enough to shake his hand. \"Mr. Nesbit,--Sturgeon--Herr Kempner--Herr Teppich,\"--he bowed stiffly to each, ran the battery of their inspection, and found himself saluting three other persons at the end of the room, under a rosy, moon-bellied lantern. A gray matron, stout, and too tightly dressed for comfort, received him uneasily, a dark-eyed girl befriended him with a look and a quiet word, while a tall man, nodding a vigorous mop of silver hair, crushed his hand in a great bony fist. \"Mrs. Earle,\" Heywood was saying, \"Miss Drake, and--how are you, padre?--Dr. Earle.\" \"Good-evening,\" boomed the giant, in a deep and musical bass. \"We are very glad, very glad.\" His voice vibrated through the room, without effort. It struck one with singular force, like the shrewd, kind brightness of his eyes, light blue, and oddly benevolent, under brows hard as granite. \"Sit down, Mr. Hackh,\" he ordered genially, \"and give us news of the other world!

I mean,\" he laughed, \"west of Suez. Smoking's allowed--here, try that!\" He commanded them, as it were, to take their ease,--the women among cushions on a rattan couch, the men stretched in long chairs. He put questions, indolent, friendly questions, opening vistas of reply and recollection; so that Rudolph, answering, felt the first return of homely comfort. A feeble return, however, and brief: in the pauses of talk, misgiving swarmed in his mind, like the leaping vermin of last night. The world into which he had been thrown still appeared disorderly, incomprehensible, and dangerous. The plague--it still recurred in his thoughts like a sombre motive; these friendly people were still strangers; and for a moment now and then their talk, their smiles, the click of billiards, the cool, commonplace behavior, seemed a foolhardy unconcern, as of men smoking in a powder magazine. \"Clearing a bit, outside,\" called Nesbit. A little, wiry fellow, with cheerful Cockney speech, he stood chalking his cue at a window. \"I say, what's the matter one piecee picnic this week? Pink Pagoda, eh? Mrs. Gilly's back, you know.\" \"No, is she?\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon, with something like enthusiasm. \"Now we'll brighten up! By Jove, that's good news. That's worth hearing. Eh, Heywood?\" \"Rather!\" drawled Rudolph's friend, with an alacrity that seemed half cynical, half enigmatic. A quick tread mounted the stairs, and into the room rose Dr. Chantel. He bowed gracefully to the padre's group, but halted beside the players. Whatever he said, they forgot their game, and circled the table to listen. He spoke earnestly, his hands fluttering in nervous gestures. \"Something's up,\" grumbled Heywood, \"when the doctor forgets to pose.\" Behind Chantel, as he wheeled, heaved the gray bullet-head and sturdy shoulders of Gilly. \"Alone?\" called the padre. \"Why, where's the Mem?\" He came up with evident weariness, but replied cheerfully:-- \"She's very sorry, and sent chin-chins all round. But to-night--Her journey, you know. She's resting.--I hope we've not delayed the concert?\" \"Last man starts it!\" Heywood sprang up, flung open a battered piano, and dragged Chantel to the stool. \"Come, Gilly, your forfeit!\" The elder man blushed, and coughed. \"Why, really,\" he stammered. \"Really, if you wish me to!\" Heywood slid back into his chair, grinning. \"Proud as an old peacock,\" he whispered to Rudolph. \"Peacock's voice, too.\" Dr. Chantel struck a few jangling chords, and skipping adroitly over sick notes, ran a flourish. The billiard-players joined the circle, with absent, serious faces. The singer cleared his throat, took on a preternatural solemnity, and began. In a dismal, gruff voice, he proclaimed himself a miner, deep, deep down:-- \"And few, I trow, of my being know, And few that an atom care!\" His hearers applauded this gloomy sentiment, till his cheeks flushed again with honest satisfaction. But in the full sweep of a brilliant interlude, Chantel suddenly broke down. \"I cannot,\" he declared sharply. As he turned on the squealing stool, they saw his face white and strangely wrought. \"I had meant,\" he said, with painful precision, \"to say nothing to-night, and act as--I cannot. Judge you, what I feel.\" He got uncertainly to his feet, hesitating. \"Ladies, you will not be alarmed.\" The four players caught his eye, and nodded. \"It is well that you know. There is no danger here, more than--I am since disinfected. Monsieur Jolivet, my compatriot--You see, you understand. Yes, the plague.\" For a space, the distant hum of the streets invaded the room. Then Heywood's book of music slapped the floor like a pistol-shot. \"You left him!\" He bounced from his chair, raging. \"You--Peng! Where's my cap?\" Quick as he was, the dark-eyed girl stood blocking his way. \"Not you, Mr. Heywood,\" she said quietly. \"I must go stay with him.\" They confronted each other, man and woman, as if for a combat of will. The outbreak of voices was cut short; the whole company stood, like Homeric armies, watching two champions. Chantel, however, broke the silence. \"Nobody must go.\" He eyed them all, gravely. \"I left him, yes. He does not need any one. Personne. Very sudden. He went to the school sick this morning. Swollen axillae--the poor fool, not to know!--et puis--enfin--He is dead.\" Heywood pitched his cap on the green field of the billiard-cloth. \"The poor pedagogue!\" he said bitterly. \"_He_ was going Home.\" Sudden, hot and cold, like the thrust of a knife, it struck Rudolph that he had heard the voice of this first victim,--the peevish voice which cried so weakly for a little silence, at early daylight, that very morning. A little silence: and he had received the great.

A little silence: and he had received the great. A gecko fell from the ceiling, with a tiny thump that made all start. He had struck the piano, and the strings answered with a faint, aeolian confusion. Then, as they regarded one another silently, a rustle, a flurry, sounded on the stairs. A woman stumbled into the loft, sobbing, crying something inarticulate, as she ran blindly toward them, with white face and wild eyes. She halted abruptly, swayed as though to fall, and turned, rather by instinct than by vision, to the other women. \"Bertha!\" protested Gilly, with a helpless stare. \"My dear!\" \"I couldn't stay!\" she cried. \"The amah told me. Why did you ever let me come back? Oh, do something--help me!\" The face and the voice came to Rudolph like another trouble across a dream. He knew them, with a pang. This trembling, miserable heap, flung into the arms of the dark-eyed girl, was Mrs. Forrester. \"Go on,\" said the girl, calmly. She had drawn the woman down beside her on the rattan couch, and clasping her like a child, nodded toward the piano. \"Go on, as if the doctor hadn't--hadn't stopped.\" Heywood was first to obey. \"Come, Chantel, chantez! Here's your song.\" He took the stool in leap-frog fashion, and struck a droll simultaneous discord. \"Come on.-- Well, then, catch me on the chorus!\" \"Pour qu' j' finisse Mon service Au Tonkin je suis parti!\" To a discreet set of verses, he rattled a bravado accompaniment. Presently Chantel moved to his side, and, with the same spirit, swung into the chorus. The tumbled white figure on the couch clung to her refuge, her bright hair shining below the girl's quiet, thoughtful face. She was shaken with convulsive regularity. In his riot of emotions, Rudolph found an over-mastering shame. A picture returned,--the Strait of Malacca, this woman in the blue moonlight, a Mistress of Life, rejoicing, alluring,--who was now the single coward in the room. But was she? The question was quick and revolting. As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him. He understood these people, recalled Heywood's saying, and with that, some story of a regiment which lay waiting in the open, and sang while the bullets picked and chose. All together: as now these half-dozen men were roaring cheerfully:-- \"Ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkinoise, Yen a d'autr's qui m' font les doux yeux, Mais c'est ell' que j'aim' le mieux!\" The new recruit joined them, awkwardly. CHAPTER IV THE SWORD-PEN \"Wutzler was missing last night,\" said Heywood, lazily. He had finished breakfast, and lighted a short, fat, glossy pipe. \"Just occurred to me. We must have a look in on him. Poor old Wutz, he's getting worse and worse. Chantel's right, I fancy: it's the native wife.\" He rose, with a short laugh. \"Queer. The rest never feel so,--Nesbit, and Sturgeon, and that lot. But then, they don't fall so low as to marry theirs.\" \"By the way,\" he sneered, on the landing, \"until this scare blows over, you'd better postpone any such establishment, if you intend--\" \"I do not,\" stammered Rudolph. To his amazement, the other clapped him on the shoulder. \"I say!\" The sallow face and cynical gray eyes lighted, for the first time, with something like enthusiasm. Next moment they had darkened again, but not before he had said gruffly, \"You're not a bad little chap.\" Morosely, as if ashamed of this outburst, he led the way through the bare, sunny compound, and when the gate had closed rattling behind them, stated their plans concisely and sourly. \"No work to-day, not a stroke! We'll just make it a holiday, catchee good time.--What? No. Rot! I won't work, and you can't. That's all there is about that. Don't be an ass! Come along. We'll go out first and see Captain Kneebone.\" And when Rudolph, faithful to certain tradesmen snoring in Bremen, would have protested mildly, he let fly a stinging retort, and did not regain his temper until they had passed the outskirts of the village. Yet even the quarrel seemed part of some better understanding, some new, subtle bond between two lonely men. Before them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like bone buttons thrown on a green carpet. Near at hand, coolies trotted and stooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny dough-balls.

Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along explaining, he threw off his surly fit. The brilliant sunlight, the breeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the gabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes, began, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday. Almost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and bargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a sampan. She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of Heywood's, and let them come aboard. Summoned by voluble scolding, her husband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep. They slipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the war-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted past like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in bright weather. They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra of pestilence. Heywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the boat-woman. As their tones rose and fell, she laughed. Long afterward, Rudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue, darting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a smile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in her ears. \"Her name is Mrs. Wu,\" said Heywood, between smoke-rings, \"and she is a lady of humor. We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes as suing a flea and winning the bite. Her maiden name was the Pretty Lily. She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not rate A. B.\" Where the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling, pattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the breeze. Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out handily. Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her name--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious yellow in the morning sun. Under these, at last, the sampan came bumping, unperceived or neglected. Overhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film of smoke. They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out. \"Kut Sing, ahoy!\" shouted Heywood. \"On deck! Kneebone!\" The shoes whipped inboard. Outboard popped a ruddy little face, set in the green circle of a _topi_, and contorted with laughter. \"Listen to this, will ye!\" cried the apparition, as though illustrating a point. Leaning his white sleeves on the rail, cigar in one fist, Tauchnitz volume in the other, he roared down over the side a passage of prose, from which his visitors caught only the words \"Ginger Dick\" and \"Peter Russet,\" before mirth strangled him. \"God bless a man,\" he cried, choking, \"that can make a lonesome old beggar laugh, out here! Eh, what? How he ever thinks up--But he's took to writing plays, they tell me. Plays!\" He scowled ferociously. \"Fat lot o' good they are, for skippers, and planters, and gory exiles! Eh, what? Be-george, I'll write him a chit! _I'll_ tell him! Plays be damned; we want more stories!\" Red and savage, he hurled the book fluttering into the sea, then swore in consternation. \"Oh, I say!\" he wailed. \"Fish her out! I've not finished her. My intention was, ye know, to fling the bloomin' cigar!\" Heywood, laughing, rescued the volume on a long bamboo. \"Just came out on the look-see, captain,\" he called up. \"Can't board you. Plague ashore.\" \"Plague be 'anged!\" scoffed the little captain. \"That hole's no worse with plague than't is without. Got two cases on board, myself--coolies. Stowed 'em topside, under the boats.--Come up here, ye castaway! Come up, ye goatskin Robinson Crusoe, and get a white man's chow!\" He received them on deck,--a red, peppery little officer, whose shaven cheeks and close gray hair gave him the look of a parson gone wrong, a hedge-priest run away to sea. Two tall Chinese boys scurried about with wicker chairs, with trays of bottles, ice, and cheroots, while he barked his orders, like a fox-terrier commanding a pair of solemn dock-rats. The white men soon lounged beside the wheel-house. \"So you brought Mrs. Forrester,\" drawled Heywood. Rudolph, wondering if they saw him wince, listened with painful eagerness. But the captain disposed of that subject very simply. \"_She's_ no good.\" He stared up at the grimy awning. \"What I'm thinking is, will that there Dacca babu at Koprah slip me through his blessed quarantine for twenty-five dollars. What?\" Their talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to touch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and Selangor.

What?\" Their talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to touch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and Selangor. They talked of men and women, a death at Zamboanga, a birth at Chittagong, of obscure heroism or suicide, and fortunes made or lost; while the two boys, gentle, melancholy, gliding silent in bright blue robes, spread a white tablecloth, clamped it with shining brass, and laid the tiffin. Then the talk flowed on, the feast made a tiny clatter of jollity in the slumbering noon, in the silence of an ocean and a continent. And when at last the visitors clambered down the iron side, they went victorious with Spanish wine. \"Mind ye,\" shouted Captain Kneebone, from the rail, \"that don't half exhaust the subjeck o' lott'ries! Why, luck\"--He shook both fists aloft, triumphantly, as if they had been full of money. \"Just ye wait. I've a tip from Calcutta that--Never mind. Bar sells, when that fortch'n comes, my boy, the half's yours! Home we go, remember that!\" The sampan drew away. Sweeping his arm violently, to threaten the coast of China and the whole range of his vision,-- \"You're the one man,\" he roared, \"that makes all this mess--worth a cowrie!\" Heywood laughed, waved his helmet, and when at last he turned, sat looking downward with a queer smile. \"Illusions!\" he chuckled. \"What would a chap ever do without 'em? Old Kneebone there: his was always that--a fortune in a lottery, and then Home! Illusions! And he's no fool, either. Good navigator. Decent old beggar.\" He waved his helmet again, before stretching out to sleep. \"Do you know, I believe--he _would_ take me.\" The clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the heated blur above the plains. As gradually, the two men sank into dreams. Furious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue twilight. She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps, up which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband. He contended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell jingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a churlish guide. At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a ponderous gate in a wall, and shouted. Some one came running, shot bolts, and swung the door inward. The lantern showed the tawny, grinning face of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange trees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall. \"These grounds are yours, Hackh,\" said Heywood. \"Your predecessor's boy; and there\"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the stunted grove--\"there's your house. You draw the largest in the station. A Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago. My boys are helping set it to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my beastly hut until this--this business takes a turn. Plenty of time.\" He nodded at the fat little orange trees. \"We may live to take our chow under those yet, of an evening. Also a drink. Eh?\" The lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential courtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road. With Rudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical ownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights. The road, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved against the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels, among dim squares of smoky lamplight. Wu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a few quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the evening stillness. At the first words, Heywood doubled his pace. \"Come along. Here's a lark--or a tragedy.\" Jostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they gained the threshold of a lighted shop. Against a rank of orderly shelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive. Before him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to the waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with incredible sounds. When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept his audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy. The merchant spoke up, timid and deprecating. As though the words were vitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a new raving. Something protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian stump. To this, all at once, his hand flung back. With a wrench and a glitter, he flourished a blade above his head.

To this, all at once, his hand flung back. With a wrench and a glitter, he flourished a blade above his head. Heywood sprang to intervene, in the same instant that the disturber of trade swept his arm down in frenzy. Against his own body, hilt and fist thumped home, with the sound as of a football lightly punted. He turned, with a freezing look of surprise, plucked at the haft, made one step calmly and tentatively toward the door, stumbled, and lay retching and coughing. The fat shop-keeper wailed like a man beside himself. He gabbled, imploring Heywood. The young man nodded. \"Yes, yes,\" he repeated irritably, staring down at the body, but listening to the stream of words. Murmurs had risen, among the goblin faces blinking in the doorway. Behind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up and echoed harshly in the street. Heywood whipped about. \"Never called me that before,\" he said quickly. \"Come outside.\" He flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm, and plunged into the crowd. The yellow men gave passage mechanically, but with lowering faces. Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly, and looked about. \"Might have known,\" he grumbled. \"Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before, or 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on.\" Rudolph followed his look. In the dim light, at the outskirts of the rabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern. The long, pale, oval face, the hard eyes gleaming with thought, had vanished at a glance. A tall, slight figure, stooping in his long robe, he glided into the darkness. For all his haste, the gait was not the gait of a coolie. \"That,\" said Heywood, turning into their former path, \"that was Fang, the Sword-Pen, so-called. Very clever chap. Of the two most dangerous men in the district, he's one.\" They had swung along briskly for several minutes, before he added: \"The other most dangerous man--you've met him already. If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend James Earle.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment. \"Yes,\" grunted his friend. \"The padre. We must find him to-night, and report.\" He strode forward, with no more comment. At his side, Rudolph moved as a soldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the apathy of a forced march. The day had been so real, so wholesome, full of careless talk and of sunlight. And now this senseless picture blotted all else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp brighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more pungent. The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment, one bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl. But his companion stalked on in silence, like a man who saw a pattern in the web of things, and was not pleased. CHAPTER V IN TOWN Night, in that maze of alleys, was but a more sinister day. The same slant-eyed men, in broken files, went scuffing over filthy stone, like wanderers lost in a tunnel. The same inexplicable noises endured, the same smells. Under lamps, the shaven foreheads still bent toward microscopic labor. The curtained window of a fantan shop still glowed in orange translucency, and from behind it came the murmur and the endless chinking of cash, where Fortune, a bedraggled, trade-fallen goddess, split hairs with coolies for poverty or zero. Nothing was altered in these teeming galleries, except that turbid daylight had imperceptibly given place to this other dimness, in which lanterns swung like tethered fire-balloons. Life went on, mysteriously, without change or sleep. While the two white men shouldered their way along, a strange chorus broke out, as though from among the crowded carcasses in a butcher's stall. Shrill voices rose in unearthly discord, but the rhythm was not of Asia. \"There goes the hymn!\" scoffed Heywood. He halted where, between the butcher's and a book-shop, the song poured loud through an open doorway. Nodding at a placard, he added: \"Here we are: 'Jesus Religion Chapel.' Hear 'em yanging! 'There is a gate that stands ajar.' That being the case, in you go!\" Entering a long, narrow room, lighted from sconces at either side, they sat down together, like schoolmates, on a low form near the door. From a dais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr. Earle dominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who sucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical inscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the late-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural exclamations. The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his giant's voice. To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but for a compelling honesty that needed no translation. This man was not preaching to heathen, but talking to men. His eyes had the look of one who speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple. Along the forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm, or suck laboriously at his pipe", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-409131abbfafd74396f07aa2c2df7b16", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his giant's voice.

His eyes had the look of one who speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple. Along the forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm, or suck laboriously at his pipe. They listened, stupid or intent. When some waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent, hailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest, and sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool. Even Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once he muttered, \"Rot!\" Toward the close, however, he leaned across and whispered, \"The old boy reels it off rather well to-night. Different to what one imagined.\" Rudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new and curious thought. A band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with an air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm. A few \"inquirers\" slouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him concerning the new faith. The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with hanging jowls, was answered sharply. He stood arguing, received another snub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and clumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen. The missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the day's work. \"That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr. Hackh--That fellow,\" he glanced after the retreating figure, \"he's a lesson in perseverance, gentlemen. A merchant, well-to-do: he has a lawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection. Cheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines. Every night he turns up, grinning and bland. I tell him it won't do, and out he goes, snorting like a dragon.\" Rudolph's impulse came to a head. \"Dr. Earle,\" he stammered, \"I owe you a gratitude. You spoke to these people so--as--I do not know. But I listened, I felt--Before always are they devils, images! And after I hear you, they are as men.\" The other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed. \"My dear young man,\" he replied, \"they're remarkably like you and me.\" After a pause, he added soberly:-- \"Images? Yes, you're right, sir. So was Adam. The same clay, the same image.\" His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned to Heywood. \"This is an unexpected pleasure.\" \"Quite,\" said the young man, readily. \"If you don't mind, padre, you made Number One talk. Fast bowling, and no wides. But we really came for something else.\" In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the shop.--So, like winking! The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down, and made finish. Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the merchant's, was this:-- \"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher. Some of his best birds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving. So he contrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien hemp. The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's neighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all. Merchant lets the matter drop. But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow, worked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot! you know their neighborhoods better than I! Well, they pushed him down-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom! He brooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus religion were the cause of all. So bang he goes down the pole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that knife. The joke is now on the merchant, eh?\" \"Just a moment,\" begged the padre. \"One thread I don't follow--the religion. Who was Christian? The merchant?\" \"Well, rather! Thought I told you,\" said Heywood. \"One of yours--big, mild chap--Chok Chung.\" The elder man sat musing. \"Yes,\" the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, \"he's one of us. Extremely honest. I'm--I'm very sorry. There may be trouble.\" \"Must be, sir,\" prompted the younger. \"The mob, meanwhile, just stood there, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know. All at once, the hindmost began squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.' We stepped outside, and there, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr. Fang.\" \"Fang?\" echoed the padre, as in doubt. \"I've heard the name.\" \"Heard?

Why, doctor,\" cried Heywood, \"that long, pale chap,--lives over toward the Dragon Spring. Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be a mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally mischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen hacks and all their false witnesses together! Hence his nickname--the Sword-Pen.\" Dr. Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor. \"Fang, the Sword-Pen,\" he growled; \"yes, there will be trouble. He hates us. Given this chance--Humph! Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman Church,\" he added, with his first trace of irritation. \"Always occurring, this thing.\" Once more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the whole burden. \"One day at a time,\" he laughed. \"Thank you for telling us.--You see, Mr. Hackh, they're not devils. The only fault is, they're just human beings. You don't speak the language? I'll send you my old teacher.\" They talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling along the streets, he called after them a resounding \"Good-night! Thanks!\"--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right Doone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel. At his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of responsibility. He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further, girt them, by a word and a look. Somehow, for the first time since landing, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled, ignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam. The feeling was but momentary. As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading the stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose. \"No dinner!\" he snapped. \"Catchee bymby, though. We must see Wutzler first. To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well, it's not hardly fair. Is it?\" They turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish. At long intervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth of the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse, between the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and silent. In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into a groove. Suddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of brick-work. The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door, which he hammered with his fist. After a time, a disgruntled voice within snarled something in the vernacular. Heywood laughed. \"Ai-yah! Who's afraid? Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!\" A bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a glow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as might have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes. The wrinkled face was Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds of a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and coolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind each other. \"Kom in,\" said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle. \"I thought you are thiefs. Kom in.\" Following through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs and rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell, lighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics. Stiff black-wood chairs lined the walls. A distorted landscape on rice-paper, narrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith flowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness. \"It iss not moch, gentlemen,\" sighed Wutzler, cringing. \"But I am ver' glad.\" Heywood flung himself into a chair. \"Not dead yet, you rascal?\" he cried. \"And we came all the way to see you. No chow, either.\" \"Oh, allow me,\" mumbled their host, in a flutter. \"My--she--I will speak, I go bring you.\" He shuffled away, into some further chamber. Heywood leaned forward quickly. \"Eat it,\" he whispered, \"whether you can or not! Pleases the old one, no bounds. We're his only visitors--\" \"Here iss not moch whiskey.\" Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle against the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs. \"I will gif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not.\" He dodged out again. They heard his angry whispers, and a small commotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters, and tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in Wonderland. Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with round eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of sight with a squeak. Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an anxious waiter, bringing in the feast. \"Here iss not moch,\" he repeated sadly. But there were bits of pig-skin stewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with dice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings, _no-me_ boiled in plantain-le", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-98178951b721b54d0b8775fe61e1ad7d", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of sight with a squeak.

But there were bits of pig-skin stewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with dice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings, _no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey, in green cups. While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed timidly, hovering about them, fidgeting. \"Herr Hackh,\" he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, \"you do not know how dis yong man iss goot! No! He hass to me--_immer_--\" He choked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not before Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks. \"Stuff! Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?\" retorted Heywood, over his shoulder. \"You talk like a bonze, Wutz.\" He winked. \"I'd rather hear the sing-song box.\" \"_Ach so_, I forget!\" Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a corner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets. \"She blay not so moch now,\" he snuffled. \"Captain Kneepone he has gifen her, when she iss all op inside for him. I haf rebaired, but she blay only one song yet. A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be. Once I haf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing, sick teufel!\" He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate gesture. \"But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!\" The streaming eyes blinked absurdly. Behind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a gabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice from neither Europe nor Asia, but America:-- \"Then did I laff? Ooh, aha-ha ha ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I could not help but laffing, Ooh, aha-ha ...\" From a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing, black-hearted guffaws. Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a stoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly. \"We're off, old chap,\" he announced. \"Bedtime. Just came to see you were all up-standing. Tough as ever? Good! Don't let--er--anything carry you off.\" At the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern. \"Dose fellows catch me?\" he mumbled, \"Der plagues--dey will forget me. All zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es dir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street. Dey haf hong up nets, and dorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house. Listen, now, dey beat gongs!--But we are white men. You--you tell me zo, to-night!\" He blubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the name of God, in a broken benediction. They had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before Heywood paused. \"That devil in the box!\" He shook himself like a spaniel. \"Queer it should get into me so. But I hate being laughed at by--anybody.\" A confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the distance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage yells, prolonged and melancholy. As the two wanderers listened,-- \"Where's the comfort,\" said Heywood, gloomily, \"of knowing somebody's worse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then. Talk of germs! why, over there, it's goblins they're scaring away. Think, behind their nets and thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down, quaking, sick with terror. Humph!--I don't mind saying\"--for a moment his hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--\"that I loathe giving this muck-hole the satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all.\" CHAPTER VI THE PAGODA He was spared that inconvenience. The untimely rain and cold, some persons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or dried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril. But accounts varied, reasons were plentiful. Soldiers had come down from the chow city, two-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and slashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a great shout of victory. A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil, then cut it adrift in the sky. A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness, and banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night, in flame.

A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness, and banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night, in flame. A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town formed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run throughout Nature. For any or all of these reasons, the town was delivered. The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant Monsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living wretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors. The relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a sea-breeze to a stoker. To escape and survive,--the bare experience seemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran. The interim had been packed with incongruity. There had been a dinner with Kempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at Teppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a native merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black yearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on rice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and vermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy. By day, there was work, or now and then a lesson with Dr. Earle's teacher, a little aged Chinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy. Under his guidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might take to drink. And with increasing knowledge came increasing tranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at every dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk. Then, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the Portuguese nunnery. Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre belongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their words and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for thought. The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a cry from the river, or the sing-song of a \"boy\" improvising some endless ballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and peaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the stunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze to indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all these, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the echoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown sisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound, and gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured. Once more he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales. And yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some tremor of disquieting knowledge. One evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked afield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the twilight. His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted, without speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic belt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs. Through these broke the shadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth. Vesper cymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first plummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin. A short bridge curved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a single arch. Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake upheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain a painting. \"It is very beautiful,\" ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond moustache with satisfaction. \"Very sightly. I would say--picturesque, no?\" \"Very,\" said Heywood, absently. \"Willow Pattern.\" \"And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?\" \"Eh, what? Oh, I wasn't listening.\" Heywood glanced carelessly at the upright sentence. That's a notice:-- \"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'\" He started on, without comment. Without reply, Rudolph followed, gathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint. Slow, far-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the night, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look, sombre and implacable. He was still pondering this, when across their winding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of equestrian silhouettes. It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough little ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing, and a woman who gayly cried at him: \"You really do understand me, don't you?\" The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things blown down the wind. But for years Rudolph had known the words, the laugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head went with them, what dangerous glancing light. Suddenly, without reason, he felt a gust of rage. It was he that understood. It was to him these things belonged. The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining memory of her power. He should be riding there, in the dusk of this lonely and cruel land.

Suddenly, without reason, he felt a gust of rage. It was he that understood. It was to him these things belonged. The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining memory of her power. He should be riding there, in the dusk of this lonely and cruel land. Heywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed aisle of bamboos. \"Well matched!\" he growled. \"Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he bounds afoot!\" Rudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight. He could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at the Flowery Pagoda. But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the fat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and shouts. They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood to fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a palanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and Sons. By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine, through the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled aquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall. Here, in the shade, grooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they trotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling country. Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green terraces of young paddy. The pink crescents of new graves scarred the hillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the venerable dead. Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in the sun like shields of brass. Over knolls and through hollows the little cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they wound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest. Above the branches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously adorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices. At the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing. The three riders broke cover in time to see Mrs. Forrester, flushed and radiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime. She stood laughing, the life and centre of a delighted group. \"And Gilbert Forrester,\" she cried, turning archly on her husband, \"said that wasn't funny!\" Gilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature. Chantel, Nesbit, and Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake quietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs. Earle smiled as in duty bound. A squad of Chinese boys, busy with tiffin-baskets, found time to grin. To this lively actress in the white gown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and the pagoda. \"Too late!\" called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the dismounting trio. \"Mr. Hackh, you should have come spurring.\" Rudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was justly proud. The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with a look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him. \"Is this Mr. Hackh?\" she said graciously. \"I've heard so much about you!\" The young man himself was almost deceived. Was there a German mail-boat? Was there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept, ignominiously, in that girl's arms? And then of a sudden he perceived, with a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had never spoken. His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was wild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge. For the first time, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other night; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of color, he could not understand how it had been overlooked. Tiffin, meanwhile, sped by like an orgy. He remembered asking so many questions, about the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl began at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong scrutiny. He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning glance toward his wine-glass. He remembered telling a brilliant story, and reciting \"Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,\"--rhymes long forgotten, now fluent and spontaneous. The applause was a triumph. Through it, as through a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled admiration. But the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company grown more silent, and Mrs. Forrester, leaning beside the door of the tower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute. The notes tinkled like a mandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the West. \"Sing for us,\" begged the dark-eyed girl; \"a native song.\" The other smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low voice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning. \"The Jasmine Flower,\" first; then, \"My Love is Gathering Dolichos\"; and then she sang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side by side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon millions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e3f2c3ab9f6fe4aa540535b1858e6332", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "a native song.\" The other smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low voice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning. \"The Jasmine Flower,\" first; then, \"My Love is Gathering Dolichos\"; and then she sang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side by side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon millions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors than offerings of spice:-- \"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land! Think you these things are but still to come? Think you they are but near at hand, Only now and here?--Behold. They were the same in years of old!\" In her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding and muttering under the camphor trees. \"And here's a song of exile,\" she said. \"I render it very badly.\"--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently above the lute. It was as though in the music she found and disclosed herself, without guile. \"...Blue was the sky, And blue the rice-pool water lay Holding the sky; Blue was the robe she wore that day. Alas, my sorrow! Why Must life bear all away, Away, away, Ah, my beloved, why?\" A murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the instrument. \"The sun's getting low,\" she said lightly, \"and I _must_ see that view from the top.\" Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as she turned to Rudolph. \"You've never seen it, Mr. Hackh? Do come help me up.\" Inside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely lighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a dangerous spiral, without guard-rail. A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph offered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious little laugh. They climbed cautiously. Once, at a halt, she stood very close, with eyes shining large in the dusk. Her slight body trembled, her head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief. \"What a queer little world!\" she whispered. \"You and I here!--I never dreamed you could be funny. It made me so proud of you, down there!\" He muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the fourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer balustrade. As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to be angry, suspicious, or glad. \"I love this prospect,\" she began quietly. \"That's why I wanted you to come.\" Beyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full, low-streaming light. The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the west, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the antique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset. All between lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and a wandering pattern of pink foot-paths. Slowly along one of these, a bright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the stillness of sea and land. Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and shrill, sounded the trilling of frogs. As the two on the pagoda stood listening,-- \"It was before Rome,\" she declared thoughtfully. \"Before Egypt, and has never changed. You and I are just--\" She broke off, humming:-- \"Only here and now? Behold They were the same in years of old!\" Her mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him. Yet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than to meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun. Through many troubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in triple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now, beside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy. It was inglorious. He tried to frown. \"You poor boy.\" Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous, she rested her hand on his arm. \"I was sorry. I thought of you so often.\" At these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance meant that she alone understood all his troubles. He started, turned for some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window behind them. \"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young face was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\" \"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\" \"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no trouble.\" All three went down the dark well together. When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging chafed legging. \"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your comedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on a pagoda?\" For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he had in China. CHAPTER VII IPHIGENIA \"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his fretful pony.

CHAPTER VII IPHIGENIA \"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his fretful pony. Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously. They two had fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting before the nunnery gate. \"A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you. The lady, in confidence, is not worth--\" \"I do not wish,\" declared Rudolph, trembling,--\"I do not wish you to say those things, so!\" \"Right!\" laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word. \"I'll give you one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will take longer--two months, to change your mind. Only\"--he looked down at Rudolph with a comic, elderly air--\"let me observe, our yellow people have that rather neat proverb. A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a battle-axe! No. Hot weather's coming, too. No sorrows of Werther, now, over such\"--He laughed again. \"Don't scowl, I'll be good. I won't say it. You'll supply the word, in two months!\" He let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter. Lonely, fuming with resentment, Rudolph stared after him. What could he know, this airy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo? Let him go, then, let him canter away. He had seen quickly, guessed with a diabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a mystery so violent and so profound. The young man stalked into his vacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him that a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred pall of tragedy. Yet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was true--a man who came too late. Another word was soon fulfilled; for the hot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious. Without gradation, the vernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling. The change came like another act of a play. One morning--though the dawn stirred cool and fragrant as all dawns before--the \"boy\" laid out Rudolph's white tunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest helmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by the same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings. Breakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling red tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion. The day flamed. At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills broke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding mirage a bright strip of magical water. Thus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay behind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes, wondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the first rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide lights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire. Their ponies whinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before the power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against the morning. Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them, sometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all the weight of his honest, tired commonplaces. But one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape. His pony bolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in a headlong dream. Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on their other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama. They had no time for words, but only laughter. Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them beyond that moment on the pagoda. And now, when their ponies fell into a shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech. \"How lucky!\" she cried. \"How lucky we came this way! Now I can really test you!\" He turned. Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for him, but for the scene. He studied that, to understand her. The river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a shallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing light, not yet compounded into day. Tussocks, innumerable clods and crumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water. On some of these storks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high on the frailest penciling of legs. In the whole expanse, no movement came but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged downward after a fish. Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like some half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze. \"There!\" said the woman, pointing. \"Are you all excuses, like the others? Or do you dare?\" \"I am not afraid of anything--now,\" retorted Rudolph, and with truth, after the dash of their twilight encounter. \"Dare what?\" \"Go see what's on that island,\" she answered", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN1IlbFNcBAHA5rAYkKiwsu+zu7M7Mm3mzu6JYNR5BUfEADWCkoPFoPTB4H4gN1hoaUVRUPMDl2F3meG+uXVFRxCoYLWJCFFO1lqr1C1pTUTRejYk22vo3/L7vN4Q+SV6O26Ms4HvQJOcpNxDXq35luj0ZlVVeqTqlXRXz6wg5T10WGKrNA8CbrNYPkuhEZa1yw1EPp/vk2Id8mXmtOlCosWfXd1A8HOTwoHuQRjcHMvjz4Er/ZJwmZhFtsK/Yqa3ynqv7NzsKNSnZwhmKUymNx5/AEX43bKWtcntku9Diiw7uRh30Bfv4hK2Un//dkDTfEeYo6hYXI4PpmTO2Op1sx4Oco6qEQJc9nn7JzNeaiUeOSB3EYP4N2En0s5202EFQCIevTBf4aP9yUA/K+EYxAh4FMdoPcoo7e9+4qj7ibHGVutT5A6oHZt8gcgbdKTr4iFIHO55JcC+whMJNvCiZyz5mmnTOO0UykH25I1KjLNvnsC/AMeY2KDA7rUkIMa1SrUmiM2zDuDHcDTiHcRuWOAbqofA5Omjc55pO32d+hIR0WEmhd8AT+hdsslhRt0BYagmyXfi0Oo09T4fBUnzPHxW3B75CR7AKl6pA2nrQalumV2p5hEHMZpz2lQl55E4wlmjm8/Rm7jY1gqoTZEZ2nJTcxFXvUO6ePJqI0n+deE9/qBRpwywhahO7nXmPG0mfVSpqjgWGKQ/BWWGSmcHtjosCEONBg/oAN6sm3ww817SOq6O3B9Js57mRlhophNsiNLLFznRYTj+VkfKhrYfXqpvlffZubZp1rv4tv0xpE42c5lsOuuCB6stiqxbmSlW7BnismVpmQ/+gldkrnOexOZW8ww/mhwaf8MMPD6m7JSU5k5l5zraKcD49cAyU0jnceSba95ByeSWYqZx4PxtFuK6odwLtkHeKRA4x2FBjGwAo6tLWXcrPpomSIOXaEv3/IM8Ij5xpIAxbYwpACrOCToRWrjc6rB4JvIdNtnKmh6oWZxL78Bv/FX+mPlprIZfSG6tH0LPVyuAT5qm1RZxovu/LJ35C4XoXyBjuwwUoko3kkdxmjPC+JAt9AP6V6YjvpiQ4dtBC1IYj1O8O3vYWavfBGCJN/xuj0t3GT5Vo3xKxsHwW7uQj4Urb0UCVPlu9LqyHi80ewwM+KthlQ+iq+JO0WXnrLPY+8xaDKLlgrx/9l21TV8dN4RbCmYGV/g0gj85AS/lGXyo661xpyKKnKvOF3NoD6ucwnpsANkpFtqsVLWwl9MIU6nnVUHCHT7Gc1kL4k8r/HOvURfboQD8wx1tAhdBObpYhG15XPMp1vFvZRBnlZvE7Oj1WdufQDrMMchNcYJYcUGupEKLJu01vAFuBJi2q6bCEUNGyYN1An5MTSUl2o1q6j4tABtET/1baQBmVcDzS218tJSMMdvYPwo3Q3zvMNceUtdiiAiESFjHfu/3+s5yBOcOtUWpdCfx8vMyzA8c6NusjwDrQQl6kHzgL4yfQlzlvoER19Eqn16BytIYZ41qBM3xLuLXyCutAGKH3MsaCOdbiyhjX9fhrOIysB0vI0cH7sUlKrtWndcq0/qW9CX6FrmledbMPkXe1E94uV6M+Crnk8Koi+TZqQartmaHAMZw5BiYhwH7DZyh3bUWw//tf8sliKNvbFxoNCQ5NDr7C47m7zqjQQ0KDp8eShIfWHJdywZ/94/xn5Doljm7WVP5H9UVVmPBHUbR72MfYyK7n+gUfg6foES/wFQJEM6rNaAt6BIFcpoV5U8tKoUcJc+swJ6FjAPbYjYzyodaHO8XuBDq6zM+o61At4lP0iTpTnSJPZlzWLPM60sj3R9PqWFkgM9Rb1FwUrrzRIqjTsATm81acDZPxeFxO5aAd0GjJsq52fe3KBMuZp2qH2Ai+cu1Xux3PJBMeX7cAhHBJZoOymVrBHKfjaY3fRg+Oztfc8sRYHbTiEi1DkG2tVK53mLhXLa17k/Crrf3QbSaZd2mnpXTbKLbSm8VO8A725B6exO3BsfwU2sl/o/4c0qWwWmTiTP4mfq43mFZxm/Qml0b8iej0Rap9tYXaJjqVTAr8BhV7PwVDzOPQcpzlSkXj2J3yYmUcOGivdfj4t3I3v0lOkxvERLSC+F7oOXzP6CaN9MeU5mzGq/Abej+9RFiLV/OjhX9p4VV9yHxhOBOqX6y9pnfyCYoAnegCs0orsz8xt0q/JV9JF+BNiC0fHdgimeVo9Dww1+nWykC74iW2kZr9gfcj+jhzzn0LFdXGsFHx69QeLk0rAV/wBwKq1os+GPjaXiL84pzIfAseV30AHHFJATrhLBJtuytauc/8EfA/1l30xdjX8X8hgDLVfYndIFq3vxvP2qzK+jLtEF0ovzTtZQuFHFhC7ucyfB+otvhFwcyoYteNd7IpxC+W3up9RxieitO4ehBDR73bn2bKLDb1GTXJPoEzoqn2PfpNeEneVTUWT3T8c+AOoQXoykYQAk/S5WQ/Pdu6S80lF/NPAtv15XgefwOIpr8rr8VT1S38Hd3tV5yHYI0/jz1NP7bsdy1wjgV93P3tI3Em20Hs8C2CixWnmo+PMCGODqYDXXB8hkyuF57XeFZgQG0XEUf9H9TBdqM="}, {"__id__": "chunk-17752cd66181b87dbe6d4ea9fb2bff3a", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "leaving his philosophic pose, plunged downward after a fish.

Or do you dare?\" \"I am not afraid of anything--now,\" retorted Rudolph, and with truth, after the dash of their twilight encounter. \"Dare what?\" \"Go see what's on that island,\" she answered. \"I dared them all. Twice I've seen natives land there and hurry away. Mr. Nesbit was too lazy to try; Dr. Chantel wearing his best clothes. Maurice Heywood refused to mire his horse for a whim. Whim? It's a mystery! Come, now. Do you dare?\" In a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied him down the bank. A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to the gulf. But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first rebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast. Fore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the shoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction. The pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red water about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse. With a clangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky, trailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures interlacing on a panel. At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a whirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her saddle, and laughing. Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not pause for this added bewilderment. The pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge and scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank. With a splash, Rudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green. As he patted the trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore. \"Oh, well done!\" she mocked them. \"Well done!\" A gust of wholesome anger refreshed him. She might laugh, but now he would see this folly through. He tore off his coat, flung it across the saddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full length in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island. Sky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the leaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him, touched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses. He lurched ashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate. A filthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit. He had come for nothing. The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of wilderness. Yet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound. What presence could lurk there? The distress, it might be, of some small animal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap. Faint as illusion, a wail, a thin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased. He moved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the isle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression. At first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at the temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he understood. This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some paltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the battlefield of some babes' crusade. A chill struck him, not from the water or the early mists. In stupor, he viewed that savage fact. Through the stillness of death sounded again the note of living discontent. He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under a withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming. By a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as an earnest or symbol of regret. Blind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow. Seeing no further than the present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned the louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the sludge. To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple feat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the naked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified pony along a tortuous bar to the land. Once in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs. Forrester canter up to join him. Indeed, he had almost forgotten her. \"Splendid!\" she laughed. \"What a figure of fun! But what can you have brought back? Oh, please! I can't wait!\" He turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently unfolded the coat. The man and the woman looked down together, in silence, at the child. He had some foolish hope that she would take it, that his part was ended. Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted and thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast whimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of arms and legs. The woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry. Her face, all gay curiosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-7efad2dc71a14d371ba2b2fc8d92a271", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "down together, in silence, at the child.

Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted and thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast whimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of arms and legs. The woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry. Her face, all gay curiosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust. \"What in the world!\" she scolded. \"Oh! Such a nasty little--Why did--What do you propose doing with it?\" Rudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder. \"I never thought of that,\" he explained heavily. \"She has no--no friends.\" \"Cover it,\" his companion ordered. \"Cover it up. I can't bear to see it.\" With a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her face he read strange matter. \"I can't bear,\" she added quickly, \"to see any kind of suffering. Why did--It's all my fault for sending you! We were having such a good ride together, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy object!\" She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture. \"But what can we do? These things happen every day.\" Rudolph was studying the ground again. His thoughts, then, had wronged her. Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his jacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable, beyond repair. She was right. Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which would not down, told him that there had been a disappointment. Still, what had he expected? No woman could help; no woman. Then suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony homeward. \"Come,\" he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge. \"What is it?\" she called. \"You foolish boy! What's your plan?\" \"We shall see,\" he answered. Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow. She came. They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at dawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels. He gave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment. Near the town, at last, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy tiles under a great willow. \"You may save your steps,\" she declared, with sudden petulance. \"The hospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded. They'll not thank you.\" Rudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half confident. \"Then,\" he replied, dismounting, \"I will replenish my nunnery.\" Squatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony. Others, in the shade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so beplastered and sopping. A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of sudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion defaced by time, cried something harshly. At his words, the whole band of idlers began to chatter. Rudolph turned to aid his companion. She sat watching them sharply. An uneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a glance for him. \"No, I shan't get down,\" she said angrily. \"It's just what might be--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us.\" He flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud, traversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun. A cooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court. Two figures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind her a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which permanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood. \"Good-morning.\" With one droll look of amusement, the girl had understood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which had the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each time like something new. \"What have you there for us?\" Again he unfolded the jacket. \"A child.\" The naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered. A somewhat nauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without haste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the Palladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble. \"It may live,\" she said. \"We'll do what we can.\" And followed by the black-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with death. A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than repugnance. Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first time in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion. Mere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp smell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister. He knew now what had been missing by the river. \"I was naked, and\"--how ran the lines? He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had never known since boyhood, never seen away from home.

He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had never known since boyhood, never seen away from home. Across a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under an enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside, listened shrewdly to his narrative. They paused at the outer gate. The padre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose joints, as if relaxed by the growing heat. Suddenly he stood erect as a grenadier. \"That lie again!\" he cried. \"Listen!\" The leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice filled with the solitary pride of intellect. \"Well, men shall revile you,\" growled Dr. Earle. \"He says we steal children, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!\" Then, heaving his wide shoulders,-- \"Oh, well!\" he said wearily, \"thanks, anyhow. Come see us, when we're not so busy? Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you.\" Tired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare. The leper cut short his snarling oration. But without looking at him, the young man took the bridle from the coolie. There had been a test. He had seen a child, and two women. And yet it was with a pang he found that Mrs. Forrester had not waited. CHAPTER VIII THE HOT NIGHT Rudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too thick a coat. In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window to window, unable to halt. A faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without breath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating, poisonous. The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp gutter. Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the stifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes glistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of crocodiles. Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched. Coolies, flung asleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of their troubled breathing. \"If I could believe,\" he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his hair. \"If I believe in her--But I came too late.\" The lamp was an added torment. He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off his forehead, and paced again. He came too late. All alone. The collar of his tunic strangled him. He stuffed his fingers underneath, and wrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was shocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments. \"This is bad,\" he thought, staring. \"It is the heat. I must not stay alone.\" He shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a coat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and moonlight to the detested club. On the stairs a song greeted him,--a fragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:-- \"Jolly boating weather, And a hay harvest breeze!\" \"Shut up!\" snarled another voice. \"Good God, man!\" The loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires. Two long punkahs flapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys. Under a swinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards, their tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest, giving them the air of desperadoes. \"Jolly boating weather,\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon. He stood apart in shadow, swaying on his feet. \"What would you give,\" he propounded thickly, \"for a hay harvest breeze?\" He climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward punkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and sprawling. \"How much does he think a man can stand?\" snapped Nesbit, his lean Cockney face pulled in savage lines. \"Beast of a song! He'll die to-night, drinking.\" \"Die yourself,\" mumbled the singer, \"'m goin' sleep. More 'n you can do.\" A groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged the hit. Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted. The game went on grimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda bottles. Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's brown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and polished in the lamplight. All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the pale Nesbit, who was winning. Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as the heat and stink of the burning oil. Only Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game perversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech. \"What's that about Rome?\" he asked. \"You were saying?\" \"Rome is safed!\" cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm. \"In your paper _Tit-bit_, I read. How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is safed by a flook of geeze. Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!

The game went on as before. \"I read alzo,\" stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to lecture, \"I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine clock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?\" He mopped his lean throat with the back of his hand. \"In Bengal are dere Rallis. Dey handle jute.\" \"Yes?\" Heywood smiled a weary indulgence. Next instant he whirled on Rudolph in fury.--\"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?\" \"I'm playing my best,\" explained Rudolph, sulkily. \"Then your best is the worst I ever saw! Better learn, before sitting in!\" Chantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards, stalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage. A long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table. The half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence. The night wore along without relief. Hours might have lapsed, when Dr. Chantel broke out as though the talk had but paused a moment. \"So it goes!\" he sneered. \"Fools will always sit in, when they do not know. They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!\" Again his laughter was brief but malignant. Heywood had left his cards, risen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into the snowy moonlight. On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident. \"It's the heat, old chap,\" he said wearily. \"Don't mind what we say to-night.\" Rudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with their quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched roofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept toward the dawn. \"These heroes!\" continued the mocker. \"What is danger? Pouf--nothing! They make it for the rest of us, so easily! Do you know,\" his voice rose and quickened, \"do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar? We murder children, it appears, for medicine!\" Rudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp. Chantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile. \"The Gascons are not all dead,\" he murmured. \"They plunge us all into a turmoil, for the sake of a woman.\" He made a sudden startling gesture, like a man who has lost control. \"For the sake,\" he cried angrily, \"of a person we all know! Oh! we all know her! She is nothing more--\" There was a light scuffle at the window. \"Dr. Chantel,\" began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, \"we are all unlike ourselves to-night. I am hardly the person to remind you, but this club is hardly the place--\" \"Oh, la la!\" The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native tongue, finished his sentence wildly. \"You cad!\" Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if gathering momentum for a collision. Before his blow could fall, he was sent spinning. Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full force, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm. Light and quick as a leopard, Chantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the floor, had whipped out a handkerchief. \"You are right, Mr. Heywood,\" he said, stanching his lips, in icy composure. His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction. \"You are right. We are not like ourselves, at present. I will better ask Mr. Sturgeon to see your friend to-morrow morning. This morning, rather.\" Not without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted gravely, and went down. \"No, no!\" panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph. \"Easy on, now! Let you go? No fear!\" Heywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and thrust him into a chair. \"Be quiet, you little ass!\" he scolded. \"I've a great mind, myself, to run after the bounder and kick him.

But that sort of thing--you did enough. Who'd have thought? You young spitfire! Chantel took you on, exactly as he wanted.\" The fat sleeper continued to snore. Wutzler came slinking back from his refuge in the shadows. \"It iss zo badt!\" he whined, gulping nervously. \"It iss zo badt!\" \"Right you are,\" said Heywood. With arms folded, he eyed them sternly. \"It's bad. We might have known. If only I'd reached him first! By Jove, you must let me fight that beast. Duels? The idiot, nobody fights duels any more. I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!\" Rudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh was unsteady, and too boisterous. \"It is well,\" he bragged. \"Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of chance! No?--All is well.\" \"Pistols? My dear young gentleman,\" scoffed his friend, \"there's not a pair of matched pistols in the settlement. And if there were, Chantel has the choice. He'll take swords.\" He paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing. From a slit in the wall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall, rise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird. \"Swords, of course,\" continued Heywood. \"If only out of vanity. Fencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but he's a beautiful swordsman! Wonderful!\" Rudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm. \"It's just as well,\" he declared quietly. Heywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief. \"My word!\" he cried, grinning. \"So you're there, too, eh? You young Sly-boots! If you're another expert--Bravo! We'll beat him at his own game! Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it! I'd give anything\"--He thumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of confetti, in a little carnival of glee. \"You old Sly-boots!--But are you sure? He's quick as lightning.\" \"I am not afraid,\" replied Rudolph, modestly. He trained his young moustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long thoughts. A quaint smile played about his eyes. \"Good for you!\" said Heywood. \"Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said of the hare. What sport! With an even chance--And what a load off one's mind!\" He moved away to the window, as though searching for air. Instead of moonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn. \"Not a word must ever reach old Gilly,\" he mused. \"Do you hear, Nesbit?\" \"If you think,\" retorted the clerk, stiffly, \"I don't know the proper course of be'aviour! Not likely!\" The tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling privately: \"A club! Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions, dead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first! We're a pack of beach-combers.\" He propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting fragments of disgust. Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly. \"Come here, you chaps. Look-see.\" The others joined him. Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering like steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light, as the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or respite. A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow street--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner. \"The Sword-Pen remains active,\" said Heywood, thoughtfully. \"That dingy little procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical? The Cross and the Dragon. Eh? Another act's coming.\" Even Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he watched the prisoner. It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant, slowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the death of the cormorant-fisher. The squad passed by. Rudolph saw again the lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with these came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly among the unthinking rabble. The Sword-Pen had written something in the dark. \"I go find out\"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip. \"Trouble's comin',\" Nesbit asserted glibly. \"There's politics afloat. But I don't care.\" He stretched his arms, with a weary howl. \"That's the first yawn I've done to-night. Trouble keeps, worse luck. I'm off--seek my downy.\" Alone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and watched the flooding daylight. \"What,\" began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, \"what is your true opinion? You are so kind, and I was just a fool. That other day, I would not listen. You laughed. Now tell me, so--as you were to die next. You were joking? Can I truly be proud of--of her?\" He leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer for the final throw. \"Of yourself, dear old chap.

Poor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan, Kashmir, Ceylon, Home. What Chantel said--well, between the two of us, I'm afraid he's right. It's a pity.\" Heywood paused, frowning. \"A pity, too, this quarrel. So precious few of us, and trouble ahead. The natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed. The least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.\" \"And the joke is,\" Rudolph added quietly, \"I do not know a sword's point from a handle.\" Heywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak. \"Rudie--old boy,\" he stammered, \"that man--Preposterous! Why, it's plain murder!\" Rudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing the haggard light of morning. A few weeks ago he might have wept; but now his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion. \"I do not care, more,\" he answered. \"Luck, so called I it, when I escaped the militar' service. Ho ho! Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I do not care, now. I cannot believe, even cannot I fight. Worthless--dreamer! My deserts. It's a good way out.\" CHAPTER IX PASSAGE AT ARMS \"Boy.\" \"Sai.\" \"S'pose Mr. Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you chin-chin he come-back.\" \"Can do.\" The long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and disappeared in the darkness. Heywood submitted his head once more to the nimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of enormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still closer. The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white walls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground floor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious young master. Nesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously. \"Sturgeon would take it all right, of course,\" he said, with airy wisdom. \"Quite the gentleman, he is. Netch'rally. No fault of his.\" \"Not the least,\" Heywood assented gloomily. \"Did everything he could. If I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't fence'--why, we might save the day. But our man won't even listen to that. Fight's the word. Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they face. But will that stop him? No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of killing. He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable! Such remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_\" The Cockney fidgeted for a time. His face--the face of a street-bred urchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning. \"I say! I was thinking,\" he ventured at last. \"Two swords, that's all? Just so. Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's. Knows that 'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook. Why not send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin' ass, and breaks a sword-blade. Perfectly netch'ral. 'Can secure, all plopah,' Accident, ye know. All off with their little duel. What?\" Heywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers. \"Last week,\" he replied. \"Not to-day. This afternoon's rather late for accidents. You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou shouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords belonged to Chantel's father. He began as a gentleman.--But you're a good sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion.\" Lost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable nonsense. \"Quite,\" said Heywood. \"We've tried reasoning. No go. As you say, an accident. That's all can save the youngster now. Impossible, of course.\" He sighed. Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and distant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth. \"Have-got! The credit's yours, Nesbit. Accident: can do.

We must pick up our young Hotspur.\" The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road. In the shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan, saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity. \"Are we ready?\"", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-8a3b55e49144523635ef63eec5d81eb9", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "Here, mafoo, makee finish!\" He sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into the sunlight. \"Come on,\" he called. \"It's nearly time. We must pick up our young Hotspur.\" The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road. In the shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan, saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity. \"Are we ready?\" he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the roof. \"I never left any place with less regret. Come, let's go.\" The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence. \"You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice. Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?\" He hesitated. \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me. I'm horribly afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd. If I knew the first motion!\" He broke out angrily. \"I cannot bear to have him laugh, also! I cannot bear!\" Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough. \"If that's all, never you fear! I'll teach you your guard. 'Once in a while we can finish in style.' Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I think we must have been brothers! We'll pull it off yet.\" Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough. This time, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing. Rudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing his head, marched on without a word. Pride and loneliness overwhelmed him. The two at his side were no companions--not even presences. He went alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black interlacing pattern of bamboos. The one friendly spirit had deserted, laughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not matter. It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death, was a lonely thing. On a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy circles under his eyes, sat waiting. A long parcel, wrapped in green baize, lay across his knees. He nodded gloomily, without rising. At his feet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with green bottle-ends, the \"dimples\" choked with discs of mud. The place was a deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives in some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild shrubs. A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with his back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons, one fat, one slender. The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph, for an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly. This final scene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly pleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque play-actors. He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity. It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly private. Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched and spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but a rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near by, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now harsh, now drowsy. Heywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:-- \"A little practice--try the balance of the swords. No more than fair.\" \"Fair? Most certainly,\" croaked that battered convivialist. \"Chantel can't object.\" He rose, and waddled down the path. Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning, then nod and smile. The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire. The fat ambassador returned. \"Right-oh,\" he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of bell-hilted swords. \"Here, try 'em out.\" His puffy eyes turned furtively toward Rudolph. \"May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I fancy.\" Then, in a burst of candor, \"Wish that unspeakable ass felt as seedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing.\" Still grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal. \"Jackets off,\" commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword under arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of plantains. The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung ponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air. Behind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal object in his hand. It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered blade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver hilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of \"H.B. St. A. Chantel,\" and a date. How long ago, he thought, the steel was forged for this day. \"It is Fate.\" He looked up sadly. \"Come, show me how to begin; so that I can stand up to him.\" \"Here, then.\" Slowly, easily, his long limbs", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN0GdYFGcCwHEVPVSIFBd2l22zM++UXYlnxYIFPY29Yqxn4UHPgme5SFSSs6OeBilSlq1T3nnnnV040agoYISLZy8RRUHReEJIrIAKscbz+X//ffg/s25mB9OnxSDYwLdyGWCl4PXo5d/4QRmT6FvgFM4Hdf5G/oxTIz9RJlMdmKnw19hX6JwlLLDK9BvrAE6wmYrmE4QTWUN6lBZPZymTnvrDcgrtt3rZdmJF4IyXl6Fgp1rpVe5t0C+vtmTzdyyDHOPk80IcbjYLMhU7w6qLibb1xitzw9musESpgm/hBaqa38IYsLZ3GvwJz8WVdg39zPoPdmjuKHRUPmDnC3+A7dbVYADbBduISsNNOZg54A2x76BKqUprJDgFNrGT2DkmHlJclnK5a44jhIyhI+Rn7mM2P9uJmB+oVjv7k8i5xig50zuRyyd3QtKmx5rYUd639Hifg1kuzUDJ5u62MFxriaYl+4/yIZgipoQuogu4HtKPAPHDjBvNBXIDzjAPpgVmO/U/JtXGWvuwtdmNaAo3xRNJgN7XyEbjZNtwVAC32FPIAGrMvhut920TmnRt/GO1txy0+6w5PEwnvhdHc0+5OzhSKeD/BkLpBMVA/KS2KrOFPDSOXiaUwwQylwg2G7X9i9KtLRHxrifMM29/vh4F+DSZ5Qi5e0Q5TrONN7xCQcgYNTUwjD7MvLYd8gloDvtGvAsTib3qIdiZN5oGE0s1cfmkHO+ogbfdKd4P7gzDBOU/Ue0wzHaQuUpEaUm5FUSB80QlTwbie1YCP6ggQnwirhan+ooy1vPt5kqZ7zW5qA8s/q7N09GB+WG9Soxj1etgkkcsuaUu1c9T6u0x4nxyIYZKUtEkX37xZeIh+JYv58azO2UNFVy8kc2mmzgffU/5mlOtNZqL6kupDA+yf1BPS2fsR90jiOPkQMRl3qRqwXoVwWm+a/JN02vCIO1EAVmkxjkdrnWGMlrH38p9xZ4nBPQAv/R3ArO0R5nRfKL7ewvl9sr94NDwLbhQqgYD8Ek40hMOZXE5s1QdQiazTUy9G6r5th2Dn1qO5nWhfXAN/Mb5xsgYV0fl2IcTKfwUguIkUCdluv8NOGoCyMXL6VZXaCDJ1ub6M/cIfSXtwH1Rhfy59At1UMxQO6KzOBovIpcbSr2yvwm/YsZIc+WWKEZx2i/T/1Su0mHCLjFLORHhM5cxk7mfYweCeZZWoRZ0wP3xdtRmsrO7cTe5xfslFSpMYAdaR8Ibwjl5b0a1eQa8wDwEJ/Qh4KzVh/dEjQ1rQdn+EexIfJuc5r9NVQuLgIIAOYJ4TL0Fd/K+IdI9tcQsuMnptIVyyH5VXAuXMcfhVu2X2Kf4TSdZJqLRPzNbx81BklINS23T8VaYFDvSvZB7gBKVb7ki2788ichkTHTdZzRqHf0Ozpb1sTlkIOfzA25F4Dbyxz1aucS9DgV6RZlx7ANUCFcSh60ryAtsqvEd/C8dzFkYsy4V3bQ+lb+ijzBpQgLE1AJ1nzbJW0hWckuK9hLz7KepiYb73GMlkoijligXfWHMUtHOOmln4WM003yEWy0viW7QZzsyiSB3MTxS9MYUA/SeWaY9KA34bSVyd12RCbvqvImBOuaZsov+DvwV9emYg2q0J6U/9SjznhDKfG7HB9Bk9NLbut0QPKY8wMAE5aNnn8JqzkZV2Q4rK9B5YABPnIthsu8dbKa7+3/GGziXynJz/bX66cJCNb3wAlNB9CRaiaSip8ojvlF/ShOivNCdMbWZ53iTyIDmkD9gT5VHMC+UH+w3nOHS774DdB95jrJMiufns7W6w+oG5bq5AHZh/xA7CjZcpXQWs2ChFMoeJT7ivlSqBdMZNpfrY+gVqpcmnV5MfE3dpW4rv9grPhndlJWGx4yBHZ63htlju+jcwQWDOGi1PKfqjU7fVngFDOpa7+rAtOQ3aCPZVUSmZa7RnZtMa8M6yPFANXYCWTEb1eXKgswWts3kZACq9t3VUexn6oGI4eAh6g3jfGws4xij9KWH+u4X38mzKVfVLGM40MlDaLNaoE6OtfBl7jYco44lotBeGwO+YIvM+x2ficH+2WgGVy5rpYPyZrTOUirPlAE1i6sSH8A0aQ8YQm8wHBOdUiR53FJDVwghaAu5R23GPS2bWL1nPiIjU/iHaC0usg8r9ImlVDHVCSd1S6ZHeY7bP/Ir5SR/OlwoNjPDXI+sU9AERzlCzkJYo/vDvJvuJ5qcM1FnY63Q4H/JyWo71ww7x4SCEu0EWM4bQS0XxR2nXtAklwWCuAEwjAgW6lGxOpK+xL9nqtzbwTnuknmBJ58aTv9FTYV1Byu8F+lqaYFbb+GkZiqVbjQbYAjcRZ/gT5M95dPma6gY9f/Ue3aj7rmyhvmdV42sMNSX49Gqv3Lb8MTIe6AfPVh6oJxljiGf+5a5xjMm757uElcA+ghVaL39grhYE8EFMQ34CyIYj7KpcgB8QMn8aDoO19GLxdfg7/KNmKmenfi5LxIlcfcoP14QWAJnuo9lpUpbHUHyWrgXxfs7weumaYSZfMoEE/stm7l2Oh3GcvfQ9zIPI6kIYYPV8+l+ArmP0jMB8oo6nl0M39AQQu9+Q4GmCZpd/weS/pOc"}, {"__id__": "chunk-4d49a7c7c613ebfca15907de30ca994f", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver hilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of \"H.B.

How long ago, he thought, the steel was forged for this day. \"It is Fate.\" He looked up sadly. \"Come, show me how to begin; so that I can stand up to him.\" \"Here, then.\" Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden youthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On Guard. \"Try it.\" Rudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless. \"Once more.--He can't see us.\" Again and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of this odd rehearsal. Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his point, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly. \"For the last time,\" he said: \"won't you let me tell him? This is extremely silly.\" Rudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child. \"Do you still think,\" he answered coldly, \"that I would beg off?\" With a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly. \"Very well, then. Once more.\" And as their blades clashed softly together, a quick light danced in his eyes. \"Here's how our friend will stick you!\" His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home. By a wild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside. His friend laughed, poised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless play, stumbled and came pitching forward. Rudolph darted back, swept his arm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a shock had run from wrist to elbow. He dropped his sword, and in stupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his third finger twitching convulsively, beyond control. \"Dear fellow!\" cried his opponent, scrambling upright. \"So sorry! I say, that's a bad one.\" With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a tourniquet, muttering condolence: \"Pain much? Lost my balance, you know. That better?--What a clumsy accident!\" Then, dodging out from the plantain screen, and beckoning,--\"All you chaps! Come over here!\" Nesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short. \"What ho!\" he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious joy. Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages. At first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to indignant shouts, haughtily approached. The little group stood at fault. Heywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then stood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity. \"I regret this more than anybody,\" he declared, pausing, and picking his words. \"We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run through the arm.\" Chantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent. \"Zut! What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has disabled himself\"-- Heywood wheeled upon him, scornfully. \"You have no right to such an expression,\" he stated, with a coldness which conveyed more rage than the other man's heat. \"This was entirely my fault. It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am quite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.\" \"I have no quarrel with you,\" replied Chantel, contemptuously. \"You saw last night how he--\" \"He was quicker than I, that's all. By every circumstance, I'm the natural proxy. Besides\"--the young man appealed to the company, smiling--\"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the occasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt.\" The doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped it. His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor, and for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it were about to be translated into bronze. His brown fingers twitched, became all nerves and sinews and white knuckles. Then, stepping backward, he withdrew from the circle. \"Very well,\" he said lightly. \"Since we are all so--irregular. I will take the substitute.\" Rudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon clung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage. \"Hold still, there!\" he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then growled in Heywood's ear, \"Why did _you_ go lose your temper?\" \"Didn't. We can't let him walk over us, though.\" The young man held the sword across his throat, and whispered, \"Only angry up to here!\" And indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as cool and ready as a young centurion. His adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen, picked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver hilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.

At last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like a man bent upon dispatch. Both men saluted formally, and sprang on guard. From the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome. Heywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full stretch, at the last wrench of skill. Chantel, for the moment, was fencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he was plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying, whether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or love of his art. Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand salute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight, scattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash. Teppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney, with narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes and finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark. Rudolph, dizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically. The hurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden path choked him like an acrid smoke. Suddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with fingers touching the ground. On \"three feet,\" he had delivered the blow so long withheld. The watchers shouted. Nesbit sprang up, released. But Heywood, by some desperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte. Still afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:-- \"Don't shout like that! Fair field, you chaps!\" Above the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices. Through the dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of crowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the compound wall. Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the foreign monsters play at this new, fantastic game. Shaven heads bobbed, saffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully. The hilts rang, the blades grated faster. But now it was plain that Heywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration. Fretted by his clumsy yet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end. He gave a panting laugh. Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the stronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel staggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and heavy. The brown missile skipped along the garden path. Another struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a bomb. A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and gasping. Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes. The air was thick with hurtling globes. Cocoanuts rained upon the company, tempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane. Among them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales of plaster. \"Aow!\" cried Nesbit, \"the bloomin' coolies!\" First to recover, he skipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts. A small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing continually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in. \"A riot!\" cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand. \"Come on, stop 'em!\" But it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path, brandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly battle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly breach. At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round corners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across paddy-fields toward the river. The tumult--except for lonely howls in the distance--ended as quickly as it had risen. The little band of Europeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like a squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled. \"That explains it,\" grumbled Heywood. He pointed along the path to where, far off, a tall, stooping figure paced slowly toward the town, his long robe a moving strip of color, faint in the twilight. \"The Sword-Pen dropped some remarks in passing.\" The others nodded moodily, too breathless for reply. Nesbit's forehead bore an ugly cut, Rudolph's bandage was red and sopping. Chantel, more rueful than either, stared down at a bleeding hand, which held two shards of steel. He had fallen, and snapped his sword in the rubble of old masonry. \"No more blades,\" he said, like a child with a broken toy; \"there are no more blades this side of Saigon.\" \"Then we must postpone.\" Heywood mopped his dripping and fiery cheeks. He tossed a piece of silver to one who wailed in the ditch,--a forlorn stranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of his small venture.--\"Contribution, you chaps. A bad day for imported cocoanuts. Wish I carried some money: this chit system is damnable.--Meanwhile, doctor, won't you forget anything I was rude enough to say? And come join me in a peg at the club? The heat is excessive.\" CHAPTER X THREE PORTALS Not till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-80e25d7dbcb1a555cabb7403e803731d", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "stranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of his small venture.--\"Contribution, you chaps.

And come join me in a peg at the club? The heat is excessive.\" CHAPTER X THREE PORTALS Not till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor. With the clerk, he lay wearily in the upper chamber of Heywood's house. The host, with both his long legs out at window, sat watching the smoky lights along the river, and now and then cursing the heat. \"After all,\" he broke silence, \"those cocoanuts came time enough.\" \"Didn't they just?\" said Nesbit, jauntily; and fingering the plaster cross on his wounded forehead, drawled: \"You might think I'd done a bit o' dueling myself, by the looks.--But I had _some_ part. Now, that accident trick. Rather neat, what? But for me, you might never have thought o' that--\" \"Idiot!\" snapped Heywood, and pulling in his legs, rose and stamped across the room. A glass of ice and tansan smashed on the floor. Rudolph was on foot, clutching his bandaged arm as though the hurt were new. \"You!\" he stammered. \"You did that!\" He stood gaping, thunderstruck. Felt soles scuffed in the darkness, and through the door, his yellow face wearing a placid and lofty grin, entered Ah Pat, the compradore. \"One coolie-man hab-got chit.\" He handed a note to his master, who snatched it as though glad of the interruption, bent under the lamp, and scowled. The writing was in a crabbed, antique German character:-- \"Please to see bearer, in bad clothes but urgent. We are all in danger. _Um Gottes willen_--\" It straggled off, illegible. The signature, \"Otto Wutzler,\" ran frantically into a blot. \"Can do,\" said Heywood. \"You talkee he, come topside.\" The messenger must have been waiting, however, at the stairhead; for no sooner had the compradore withdrawn, than a singular little coolie shuffled into the room. Lean and shriveled as an opium-smoker, he wore loose clothes of dirty blue,--one trousers-leg rolled up. The brown face, thin and comically small, wore a mask of inky shadow under a wicker bowl hat. His eyes were cast down in a strange fashion, unlike the bold, inquisitive peering of his countrymen,--the more strange, in that he spoke harshly and abruptly, like a racer catching breath. \"I bring news.\" His dialect was the vilest and surliest form of the colloquial \"Clear Speech.\"--\"One pair of ears, enough.\" \"You can speak and act more civilly,\" retorted Heywood, \"or taste the bamboo.\" The man did not answer, or look up, or remove his varnished hat. Still downcast and hang-dog, he sidled along the verge of the shadow, snatched from the table the paper and a pencil, and choosing the darkest part of the wall, began to write. The lamp stood between him and the company: Heywood alone saw--and with a shock of amazement--that he did not print vertically as with a brush, but scrawled horizontally. He tossed back the paper, and dodged once more into the gloom. The postscript ran in the same shaky hand:-- \"Send way the others both.\" \"What!\" cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder, \"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say.\" He led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted dinner-table. The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and thrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow. \"Eng-lish speak I ver' badt,\" he whispered; and then with something between gasp and chuckle, \"but der _pak-wa_ goot, no? When der live dependt, zo can mann--\" He caught his breath, and trembled in a strong seizure. \"Good?\" whispered Heywood, staring. \"Why, man, it's wonderful! You _are_ a coolie\"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow. \"I beg your pardon. I mean, you're--\" The shrunken figure pulled itself together. \"You are right,\" he whispered, in the vernacular. \"To-night I am a coolie--all but the eyes. Therefore this hat.\" Heywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out. The dim hall was empty. \"Go on,\" he said, returning. \"What is your news?\" \"Riots. They are coming. We are all marked for massacre. All day I ran about the town, finding out. The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_ Christian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.' They kept asking, 'Do you follow the foreign dogs and goats?' But he would only answer, 'I follow the Lord Jesus.' So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy shoe, and cast him into prison. Now they wait, to see if his padre will interfere with the law. It is a trap.

The suit is certainly brought by Fang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.\" \"That much,\" said Heywood, \"I could have told you.\" Wutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows might hear. \"But there is more. Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to gossip. I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water. You know this sign?\" He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his thigh. \"It is for protection in the streets. It says, 'I am a Heaven-and-Earth man.'\" \"The Triad!\" Heywood whistled. \"You?\" The other faltered, and hung his head. \"Yes,\" he whispered at last. \"My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass Sandal. He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm, now, we of the Triad. But there is another secret band, having many of our signs. It is said they ape our ritual. Fang the scholar heads their lodge. They are the White Lotus.\" \"White Lotus?\" Heywood snapped his fingers. \"Nonsense. Extinct, this hundred years.\" \"Extinct? They meet to-night,\" said the outcast, in sudden grief and passion. \"They drink blood--plan blood. Extinct? Are _you_ married to these people? Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price? All these years--darkness--sunken--alone\"--He trembled violently, but regained his voice. \"O my friend! This very night they swear in recruits, and set the day. I know their lodge-room. For any sake, believe me! I know!\" \"Right,\" said Heywood, curtly. \"I believe you. But why come here? Why not stay, and learn more?\" Wutzler's head dropped on his breast again. The varnished hat gleamed softly in the darkness. \"I--I dare not stay,\" he sobbed. \"Oh, exactly!\" Heywood flung out an impatient arm. \"The date, man! The day they set. You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in ignorance.\" The droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that streaked the mangrove stain. \"My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night. I found a listening place--next door: a long roof. You can hear and see them--But I could not stay. Yes, I am a coward.\" \"There, there!\" Heywood patted his shoulder. \"I didn't mean--Here, have a drink.\" The man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing miserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up bold and shrewd. \"Do you?\" he whispered. \"Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and hide? You would learn.\" Heywood started visibly, paused, then laughed. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"_Tu quoque_ is good argument. Can you smuggle me?--Then come on.\" He stepped lightly across the landing, and called out, \"You chaps make yourselves at home, will you? Business, you know. What a bore! I'll not be back till late.\" And as he followed the slinking form downstairs, he grumbled, \"If at all, perhaps.\" The moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above the crouching roofs. The two men hurried along a \"goat\" path, skirted the town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of lonely streets. Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some joss-house, they halted before a blind wall. \"In the first room,\" whispered the guide, \"a circle is drawn on the floor. Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle men,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus. These men hate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass. You come from the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the Red Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because\"--He lectured earnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over. \"No: not so. Say it exactly, after me.\" They held a hurried catechism in the dark. \"There,\" sighed Wutzler, at last, \"that is as much as we can hope. Do not forget. They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very rash. It is not too late to go home.\" Receiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated knock. Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened. \"Who comes?\" said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue. \"A brother,\" answered the outcast, \"to pluck the White Lotus. Aid, brothers.--Go in, I can help no further. If you are caught, slide down, and run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of the Dragons.\" Heywood nodded, and slipped in. Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil, a broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and stared with cruel, unblinking eyes.

Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil, a broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and stared with cruel, unblinking eyes. If the stranger were the first white man to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign. On the earthen floor lay a small circle of white lime. Heywood placed his right foot inside it. \"We are all in-the-circle men.\" \"Pass,\" said the guard. Out from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door in the far corner. In the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light on the same table. But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and pendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in a row. Heywood lifted the central cup, and drank. \"Will you bite the clouds?\" asked the second guard, in a soft and husky bass. As he spoke, the great nose trembled slightly. \"No, I will bite ginger,\" replied the white man. \"Why is your face so green?\" \"It is a melon-face--a green face with a red heart.\" \"Pass,\" said the <DW36>, gently. He pulled a cord--the nose quaking with this exertion--and opened the third door. Again the chamber was dim. A venerable man in gleaming silks--a grandfather, by his drooping rat-tail moustaches--sat fanning himself. In the breath of his black fan, the lamplight tossed queer shadows leaping, and danced on the table of polished camagon. Except for this unrest, the aged face might have been carved from yellow soapstone. But his slant eyes were the sharpest yet. \"You have come far,\" he said, with sinister and warning courtesy. Too far, thought Heywood, in a sinking heart; but answered:-- \"From the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls.\" \"And where did you study?\" The black fan stopped fluttering. \"In the Red Flower Pavilion.\" \"What book did you read?\" \"The book,\" said Heywood, holding his wits by his will, \"the book was Ten Thousand Thousand Pages.\" \"And the theme?\" \"The waters of the deluge crosswise flow.\" \"And what\"--the aged voice rose briskly--\"what saw you on the waters?\" \"The Eight Abbots, floating,\" answered Heywood, negligently.--\"But,\" ran his thought, \"he'll pump me dry.\" \"Why,\" continued the examiner, \"do you look so happy?\" \"Because Heaven has sent the Unicorn.\" The black fan began fluttering once more. It seemed a hopeful sign; but the keen old eyes were far from satisfied. \"Why have you such a sensual face?\" \"I was born under a peach tree.\" \"Pass,\" said the old man, regretfully. And Heywood, glancing back from the mouth of a dark corridor, saw him, beside the table of camagon, wagging his head like a judge doubtful of his judgment. The narrow passage, hot, fetid, and blacker than the wholesome night without, crooked about sharp corners, that bruised the wanderer's hands and arms. Suddenly he fell down a short flight of slimy steps, landing in noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt. A trap, a suffocating well, he thought; and rose filthy, choked with bitterness and disgust. Only the taunting justice of Wutzler's argument, the retort _ad hominem_, had sent him headlong into this dangerous folly. He had scolded a coward with hasty words, and been forced to follow where they led. To this loathsome hole. Behind him, a door closed, a bar scraped softly into place. Before him, as he groped in rage and self-reproach, rose a vault of solid plaster, narrow as a chimney. But presently, glancing upward, he saw a small cluster of stars blinking, voluptuous, immeasurably overhead. Their pittance of light, as his eyesight cleared, showed a ladder rising flat against the wall. He reached up, grasped the bamboo rungs, hoisted with an acrobatic wrench, and began to climb cautiously. Above, faint and muffled, sounded a murmur of voices. CHAPTER XI WHITE LOTUS He was swarming up, quiet as a thief, when his fingers clawed the bare plaster. The ladder hung from the square end of a protruding beam, above which there were no more rungs. He hung in doubt. Then, to his great relief, something blacker than the starlight gathered into form over his head,--a slanting bulk, which gradually took on a familiar meaning. He chuckled, reached for it, and fingering the rough edge to avoid loose tiles, hauled himself up to a foothold on the beam, and so, flinging out his arms and hooking one knee, scrambled over and lay on a ribbed and mossy surface, under the friendly stars.

The outcast and his strange brethren had played fair: this was the long roof, and close ahead rose the wall of some higher building, an upright blackness from which escaped two bits of light,--a right angle of hairbreadth lines, and below this a brighter patch, small and ragged. Here, louder, but confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the rival lodge. Toward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles. Once a broken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof. He sat up, every muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him sliding after it into the lower darkness. It fell but a short distance, into something soft. Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still. Nothing followed; no one had heard. He tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and safe in the angle where roof met wall. The voices and shuffling feet were dangerously close. He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his face, and peered in through the ragged chink. Two legs in bright, wrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked the view. For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing. He could hear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning. The legs moved away, and left a clear space. But at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly overhead, out of doors. The thin right angle of light spread instantly into a brilliant square. With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open. Heywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves, and the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the night air. \"_Ai-yah!\"_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo. \"It is hot.\" Heywood tried to blot himself against the wall. The lounger, propped on elbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive silhouette. \"_Ai-yah!\"_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his head. Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning sparks from his wrist. In the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy through the chink. This time the bright-hosed legs were gone. He saw clear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and shining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded men, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony, faced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily cheeks. The chatter had ceased. Under the crowded rows of shaven foreheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant. At the far end of the loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood at last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense jar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling with candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale, carved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded shrine of the Patriot War-God. A tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart the altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a round wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which stuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace carved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe, gleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers. All these, and more, he displayed aloft and replaced among the candles. When his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into the lane. \"O Fragrant Ones,\" he shrilled, \"I bring ten thousand recruits, to join our army and swear brotherhood. Attend, O Master of Incense.\" Behind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes, with queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch. They crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray silk sternly examined their sponsor. In the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and shoulders ached. He could make nothing of the florid verbiage. With endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords. They knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of incense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies. Above them the tall Master of Incense thundered:-- \"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the ground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that cleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five Regions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass through unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the draught of blood.\" He raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement, unrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed. From this he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths. Heywood could catch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:-- \"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand knives.\" \"--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.\" \"--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him.\" Silence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-71d99b7f78b8977afbaeb638a1b23512", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed. From this he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths. Heywood could catch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:-- \"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand knives.\" \"--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.\" \"--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him.\" Silence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl, as suddenly cut short. Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling and beating. Next instant he lay flattened against the wall. The shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out. Within reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped the neck of a white cock. The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly, flapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms reached out and sliced with a knife. The cock's head flew off upon the tiles. Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek. Half blinded, but not daring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out to catch the flow. Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of sight, and the shutter slid home. \"Twice they've not seen me,\" thought Heywood. It was darker, here, than he had hoped. He rose more boldly to the peep-hole. Under the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright, stretched one by one their wrists over the goblet. The Incense Master pricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the white cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim. It passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup. Each novice raised it, chanted some formula, and drank. Then all dispersed. There fell a silence. Suddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine, the eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt. The lips moved. The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:-- \"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this cock?\" A man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:-- \"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.\" \"How shall we know the hour?\" \"The hour,\" replied the Red Wand, \"shall be when the Black Dog barks.\" \"And the day?\" Heywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses fused into one. No answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely familiar and commonplace. He peered in again. The Red Wand stood by the abacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff. Plainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer. The listener clapped his ear to the crevice. Would that answer, he wondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow? The shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the plaster. Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles. A head, the flattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the little port-hole. Grunting, he shook the inverted cup, let it dangle from his hands, stared up aimlessly at the stars, and then--to Heywood's consternation--dropped his head to meditate, looking straight down. \"He sees me,\" thought Heywood, and held himself ready, trembling. But the fellow made no sign, the broad squat features no change. The pose was that of vague, comfortable thought. Yet his vision seemed to rest, true as a plumb-line, on the hiding-place. Was he in doubt?--he could reach down lazily, and feel. Worst of all, the greenish pallor in the eastern sky had imperceptibly turned brighter; and now the ribbed edge of a roof, across the way, began to glow like incandescent silver. The moon was crawling up. The head and the dangling goblet were slowly pulled in, just before the moonlight, soft and sullen through the brown haze of the heat, stole down the wall and spread upon the tiles. The shutter remained open. But Heywood drew a free breath: those eyes had been staring into vacancy. \"Now, then,\" he thought, and sat up to the cranny; for the rattle of the abacus had stopped. \"The counting is complete,\" announced the Red Wand slowly, \"the hours are numbered. The day--\" Movement, shadow, or nameless instinct, made the listener glance upward swiftly. He caught the gleam of yellow silk, the poise and downward jab, and with a great heave of muscles went shooting down the slippery channel of the cock's blood. A spearhead grazed his scalp, and smashed a tile behind him. As he rolled over the edge, the spear itself whizzed by him into the dark. \"The chap saw,\" he thought, in mid-air; \"beastly clever--all the time--\" He landed on the spear-shaft, in a pile of dry rubbish, snatched up the weapon, and ran, dimly conscious of a quiet scurrying behind and above him, of silent men tumbling after, and doors flung violently open. He raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at his back. Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where dragons met.

He raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at his back. Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where dragons met. There had been no uproar; but running his hardest down the empty corridors of the streets, he felt that the pack was gaining. Ahead loomed something gray, a wall, the end of a blind alley. Scale it, or make a stand at the foot,--he debated, racing. Before the decision came, a man popped out of the darkness. Heywood shifted his grip, drew back the spear, but found the stranger bounding lightly alongside, and muttering,-- \"To the west-south, quick! A brother waits. I fool those who follow--\" Obeying, Heywood dove to the left into the black slit of an alley, while the other fugitive pattered straight on into the seeming trap, with a yelp of encouragement to the band who swept after. The alley was too dark for speed. Heywood ran on, fell, rose and ran, fell again, losing his spear. A pair of trembling hands eagerly helped him to his feet. \"My cozin's boy, he ron quick,\" said Wutzler. \"Dose fellows, dey not catch him! Kom.\" They threaded the gloom swiftly. Wutzler, ready and certain of his ground, led the tortuous way through narrow and greasy galleries, along the side of a wall, and at last through an unlighted gate, free of the town. In the moonlight he stared at his companion, cackled, clapped his thighs, and bent double in unholy convulsions. \"My gracious me!\" He laughed immoderately. \"Oh, I wait zo fearful, you kom zo fonny!\" For a while he clung, shaking, to the young man's arm. \"My friendt, zo fonny you look! My gootness me!\" At last he regained himself, stood quiet, and added very pointedly, \"What did _yow_ lern?\" \"Nothing,\" replied Heywood, angrily. \"Nothing. Fragrant Ones! Not a bad name. Phew!--Oh, I say, what did they mean? What Black Dog is to bark?\" \"Black Dog? Black Dog iss cannon.\" The man became, once more, as keen as a gossip. \"What cannon? When dey shoot him off?\" \"Can't tell,\" said his friend. \"That's to be their signal.\" \"I do not know,\" The conical hat wagged sagely. \"I go find out.\" He pointed across the moonlit spaces. \"Ofer dere iss your house. You can no more. _Schlafen Sie wohl_.\" The two men wrung each other's hands. \"Shan't forget this, Wutz.\" \"Oh, for me--all you haf done--\" The outcast turned away, shaking his head sadly. Never did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he gained the vaulted bath-room. He ripped off his blood-stained clothes, scrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool water luxuriously over his exhausted body. When at last he had thrown a kimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to see Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and ardently twisting his little moustache. As Heywood entered, he wheeled, stared long and solemnly. \"I must wait to tell you.\" He stalked forward, and with his sound left hand grasped Heywood's right. \"This afternoon, you--\" \"My dear boy, it's too hot. No speeches.\" But Rudolph's emotion would not be hindered. \"This afternoon,\" he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, \"this afternoon I nearly was killed.\" \"So was I.--Which seems to meet that.\" And Heywood pulled free. \"Oh,\" cried Rudolph, fervently. \"I know! I feel--If you knew what I--My life--\" The weary stoic in the blue kimono eyed him very coldly, then plucked him by the sleeve.--\"Come here, for a bit.\" Both men leaned from the window into the hot, airless night. A Chinese rebeck wailed, monotonous and nasal. Heywood pointed at the moon, which now hung clearly above the copper haze. \"What do you see there?\" he asked dryly. \"The moon,\" replied his friend, wondering. \"Good.--You know, I was afraid you might just see Rudie Hackh.\" The rebeck wailed a long complaint before he added:-- \"If I didn't like you fairly well--The point is--Good old Cynthia! That bally orb may not see one of us to-morrow night, next week, next quarter. 'Through this same Garden, and for us in vain.' Every man Jack. Let me explain. It will make you better company.\" CHAPTER XII THE WAR BOARD \"Rigmarole?\" drawled Heywood, and abstained from glancing at Chantel. \"Dare say. However, Gilly, their rigmarole _may_ mean business. On that supposition, I made my notes urgent to you chaps.\" \"Quite right,\" said Mr. Forrester, tugging his gray moustache, and studying the floor. \"Obviously. Rigmarole or not, your plan is thoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify.\" Chantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes which roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-ce8decdd14fcac24539dbd5c797ec474", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "mean business.

Rigmarole or not, your plan is thoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify.\" Chantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes which roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast of the few small junks that lay moored against the distant bank. He bore himself, to-day, like a lazy cock of the walk. The rest of the council, Nesbit, Teppich, Sturgeon, Kempner, and the great snow-headed padre, surrounded the table with heat-worn, thoughtful faces. When they looked up, their eyes went straight to Heywood at the head; so that, though deferring to his elders, the youngest man plainly presided. Chantel turned suddenly, merrily, his teeth flashing in a laugh. \"If we are then afraid, let us all take a jonc down the river,\" he scoffed, \"or the next vessel for Hongkong!\" Gilly's tired, honest eyes saw only the plain statement. \"Impossible.\" He shook his bullet head. \"We can't run away from a rumor, you know. Can we, now? The women, perhaps. But we should lose face no end--horribly.\" \"Let's come to facts,\" urged Heywood. \"Arms, for example. What have we? To my knowledge, one pair of good rifles, mine and Sturgeon's. Ammunition--uncertain, but limited. Two revolvers: my Webley.450, and that little thing of Nesbit's, which is not man-stopping. Shot-guns? Every one but you, padre: fit only for spring snipe, anyway, or bamboo partridge. Hackh has just taken over, from this house, the only real weapons in the settlement--one dozen old Mausers, Argentine, calibre.765. My predecessor left 'em, and three cases of cartridges. I've kept the guns oiled, and will warrant the lot sound.--Now, who'll lend me spare coolies, and stuff for sand-bags?\" \"Over where?\" puffed Sturgeon. \"Where's he taking your Mausers?\" \"Nunnery, of course.\" \"Oh, I say!\" Mr. Forrester looked up, with an injured air. \"As the senior here, except Dr. Earle, I naturally thought the choice would be my house.\" \"Right!\" cried two or three voices from the foot of the table. \"It should be--Farthest off--\" All talked at once, except Chantel, who eyed them leniently, and smiled as at so many absurd children. Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a pompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose and delivered a pointless oration. \"Ignoring race and creed,\" he droned, \"we must stand together--\" Heywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing. On the polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig, whose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes. \"Whistle away!\" he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted: \"Very good of you, Gilly. But with your permission, I see five points.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago.\" He tossed on the table a sheet of paper. Forrester spread it, frowning, while the others leaned across or craned over his chair. \"All out of whack, you see,\" explained the draughtsman; \"but here are my points, Gilly. One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to defend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction. Boats? Not hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare. Anyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops roundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field. Third: the Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I dare say, but your place has no well whatever. And as to four, suppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another half-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a bell to ring.\" Gilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his throat. \"Gentlemen,\" he declared slowly, \"you once did me the honor to say that in--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head. Frankly, I confess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague. I wish to--briefly, to resign, in favor of this young--ah--bachelor.\" \"Don't go rotting me,\" complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned ruddy. \"I merely bring up these points.

For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!\" He made a pantomime of chop-sticks. \"A compound full, eating, eating!\" One or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their council-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker. \"Our everlasting shame, then,\" he replied quietly. \"It will be everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting them loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to mince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em? Damned if we do!\" No one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly, musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that somewhat trembled. \"Besides,\" continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, \"we'll need 'em to man the works. Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh? Look here.\" With rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map. \"I must run a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of sand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters and pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a mound or platform.--What do you say? Suggestions, please!\" Chantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose. He paused, struck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the breeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette. \"Since we have appointed our dictator,\" he began amiably, \"we may repose--\" From the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of the house. \"Wutzler!\" said Heywood, jumping up. \"I mean--his messenger.\" He was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling. \"Good news, Gilly.\" He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on with pencil. \"We need expect nothing these ten days. They wait for more ammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it. The Hak Kau--their Black Dog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607. He writes, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day. O.W.' Gentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports. Thorough, rather? Little O.W. is O.K.\" Chantel, still humming, had moved toward the door. All at once he halted, and stared from the landward window. Cymbals clashed somewhere below. \"What's this?\" he cried sharply. The noise drew nearer, more brazen, and with it a clatter of hoofs. \"Here come swordsmen!\" \"To play with you, I suppose. Your fame has spread.\" Heywood spoke with a slow, mischievous drawl; but he crossed the room quickly. \"What's up?\" Below, by the open gate, a gay grotesque rider reined in a piebald pony, and leaning down, handed to the house-boy a ribbon of scarlet paper. Behind him, to the clash of cymbals, a file of men in motley robes swaggered into position, wheeled, and formed the ragged front of a Falstaff regiment. Overcome by the scarlet ribbon, the long-coated \"boy\" bowed, just as through the gate, like a top-heavy boat swept under an arch, came heaving an unwieldy screened chair, borne by four broad men: not naked and glistening coolies, but \"Tail-less Horses\" in proud livery. Before they could lower their shafts, Heywood ran clattering down the stairs. Slowly, cautiously, like a little fat old woman, there clambered out from the broadcloth box a rotund man, in flowing silks, and a conical, tasseled hat of fine straw. He waddled down the compound path, shading with his fan a shrewd, bland face, thoughtful, yet smooth as a babe's. The watchers in the upper room saw Heywood greet him with extreme ceremony, and heard the murmur of \"Pray you, I pray you,\" as with endless bows and deprecations the two men passed from sight, within the house. A long time dragged by. The visitor did not join the company, but from another room, now and then, sounded his clear-pitched voice, full of odd and courteous modulations. When at last the conference ended, and their unmated footsteps crossed the landing, a few sentences echoed from the stairway. \"That is all,\" declared the voice, pleasantly. \"The Chow Ceremonial says, 'That man is unwise who knowingly throws away precious things.' And in the Analects we read, 'There is merit in dispatch.'\" Heywood's reply was lost, except the words, \"stupid people.\" \"In every nation,\" agreed the placid voice. \"It is true. What says the Viceroy of Hupeh: 'They see a charge of bird-shot, and think they are tasting broiled owl.'--Walk slowly!\" \"A safe walk, Your Excellency.\" The cymbals struck up, the cavalcade, headed by ragamuffin lictors with whips, went swaying past the gate.

Heywood, when he returned, was grinning. \"Wonderful old chap!\" he exclaimed. \"Hates this station, I fancy, much as we hate it.\" \"Anything to concern us?\" asked Gilly. \"Intimated he could beat me at chess,\" laughed the young man, \"and will bet me a jar of peach wine to a box of Manila cigars!\" Chantel, from a derisive dumb-show near the window, had turned to waddle solemnly down the room. At sight of Heywood's face he stopped guiltily. \"Chantel!\" All the laughter was gone from the voice and the hard gray eyes. \"Yesterday we humored you tin-soldier fashion, but to-day let's put away childish things.--I like that magistrate, plainly, a damned deal better than I like you. When you or I show one half his ability, we're free to mock him--in my house.\" For the first time within the memory of any man present, the mimic wilted. \"I--I did not know,\" he stammered, \"that old man was your friend.\" Very quiet, and a little flushed, he took his seat among the others. \"I like him no end.\" Still more quiet, Heywood appealed to the company. \"Part for his hard luck--stuck down, a three-year term, in this neglected hole. Enemies in power, higher up. Fang, the Sword-Pen, in great favor up there.--What? Oh, said nothing directly, of course. Friendly call, and all that. But his indirections speak straight enough. We understood each other. The dregs of the town are all stirred up--bottomside topside--danger point. He, in case--you know--can't give us any help. No means, no recourse. His chief's fairly itching to cashier him.--Spoke highly of your hospital work, padre, but said, 'Even good deeds may be misconstrued.'--In short, gentlemen, without saying a word, he tells us honestly in plain terms, 'Sorry, but look out for yourselves.'\" A beggar rattled his bowl of cash in the road, below; from up the river sounded wailing cries. \"Did he mention,\" said the big padre, presently, \"the case against my man, Chok Chung?\" Heywood's eyes became evasive, his words reluctant. \"The magistrate dodged that--that unpleasant subject. The case was forced on him. Some understrapper tried it. Let's be fair.\" Dr. Earle's great elbows left the board. Without rising, he seemed to grow in bulk and stature, and send his vision past the company, into those things which are not, to confound the things which are. \"For myself, it does not matter. 'He buries His workmen, but carries on His work.'\" The man spoke in a heavy, broken voice, as though it were his body that suffered. \"But it comes hard to hear, from a young man, so good a friend, after many years\"--The deep-set eyes returned, and with a sudden lustre, made a sharp survey from face to face. \"If I have made my flock a remnant--aliens--rejected--tell me, what shall I do? Tell me. I have shut eyes and conscience, and never meddled, never!--not even when money was levied for the village idols. And here's a man beaten, cast into prison--\" He shoved both fists out on the table, and bowed his white head. \"My safety is nothing. But yours--and his.--To keep one, I desert the other. Either way.\" The padre groaned. \"What must I choose?\" \"We're all quite helpless,\" said Heywood, gently. \"Quite. It's a long way to the nearest gunboat.\" \"Tell me,\" repeated the other, stubbornly. At the same moment it happened that the cries came louder along the river-bank, and that some one bounded up the stairs. The runner was Rudolph. All morning he had gone about his errands very calmly, playing the man of action, in a new philosophy learned overnight. But now he forgot to imitate his teacher, and darted in, so headlong that all the dogs came with him, bouncing and barking. \"Look,\" he called, stumbling toward the farther window, while Flounce the terrier and a wonk puppy ran nipping at his heels. \"Come, look at them! Out on the river!\" CHAPTER XIII THE SPARE MAN Beyond the scant greenery of Heywood's garden--a ropy little banyan, a low rank of glossy whampee leaves, and the dusty sage-green tops of stunted olives--glared the river. Wide, savage sunlight lay so hot upon it, that to aching eyes the water shone solid, like a broad road of yellow clay.

Only close at hand and by an effort of vision, appeared the tiny, quiet lines of the irresistible flood pouring toward the sea; there whipped into the pool of banyan shade black snippets and tails of reflection, darting ceaselessly after each other like a shoal of frightened minnows. But elsewhere the river lay golden, solid, and painfully bright. Things afloat, in the slumberous procession of all Eastern rivers, swam downward imperceptibly, now blurred, now outlined in corrosive sharpness. The white men stood crowding along the spacious window. The dogs barked outrageously; but at last above their din floated, as before, the high wailing cries. A heaping cairn of round-bellied, rosy-pink earthen jars came steering past, poled by a naked statue of new copper, who balanced precariously on the edge of his hidden raft. No sound came from him; nor from the funeral barge which floated next, where still figures in white robes guarded the vermilion drapery of a bier, decked with vivid green boughs. All these were silent. \"No, above!\" cried Rudolph, pointing. After the mourners' barge, at some distance, came hurrying a boat crowded with shining yellow bodies and dull blue jackets. Long bamboo poles plied bumping along her gunwale, sticking into the air all about her, many and loose and incoordinate, like the ribs of an unfinished basket. From the bow spurted a white puff of smoke. The dull report of a musket lagged across the water. The bullet skipped like a schoolboy's pebble, ripping out little rags of white along that surface of liquid clay. The line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark. Untouched, a black head bobbed vigorously in the water, some few yards before the boat. The saffron crew, poling faster, yelled and cackled at so clean a miss, while a coolie in the bow reloaded his matchlock. The fugitive head labored like that of a man not used to swimming, and desperately spent. It now gave a quick twist, and showed a distorted face, almost of the same color with the water. The mouth gaped black in a sputtering cry, then closed choking, squirted out water, and gaped once more, to wail clearly:-- \"I am Jesus Christ!\" In the broad, bare daylight of the river, this lonely and sudden blasphemy came as though a person in a dream might declare himself to a waking audience of skeptics. The cry, sharp with forlorn hope, rang like an appeal. \"Why--look,\" stammered Heywood. \"He sees us--heading here. Look, it's--Quick! let me out!\" Just as he turned to elbow through his companions, and just as the cry sounded again, the matchlock blazed from the bow. No bullet skipped. The swimmer, who had reached the shallows, suddenly rose with an incredible heave, like a leaping salmon, flung one bent arm up and back in the gesture of the Laocooen, and pitched forward with a turbid splash. The quivering darkness under the banyan blotted everything: death had dispersed the black minnows there, in oozy wriggles of shadow; but next moment the fish-tail stripes chased in a more lively shoal. The gleaming potter, below his rosy cairn, stared. The mourners forgot their grief. Heywood, after his impulse of rescue, stood very quiet. \"You saw,\" he repeated dully. \"You all saw.\" The clutching figure, bolt upright in the soaked remnant of prison rags, had in that leap and fall shown himself for Chok Chung, the Christian. He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the drunken cormorant-fisher. Obscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and flourish of bamboo poles. \"Come away from the window,\" said Heywood; and then to the white-haired doctor: \"Your question's answered, padre. Strange, to come so quick.\" He jerked his thumb back toward the river. \"And that's only first blood.\" The others had broken into wrangling. \"Escaped? Nonsense--Cat--and--mouse game, I tell you; those devils let him go merely to--We'll never know--Of course! Plain as your nose--To stand by, and never lift a hand! Oh, it's--Rot! Look here, why--Acquitted, then set on him--But we'll _never_ know!--Fang watching on the spot. Trust him!\" A calm \"boy,\" in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak. The dispute paused, while they turned for his message. It was a disappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to walk home. \"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\" \"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood. \"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company. \"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare. You go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\" Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph marched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late spectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the one.\" He descended, muttering. Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the compound gate to fare no better with the woman.

Bowing stiffly, Rudolph marched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late spectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the one.\" He descended, muttering. Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the compound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of his first exile and of his recent youth. It was now as though that youth came flooding back to greet her. \"Good-morning.\" He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless moments they would be walking side by side. She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips trembling, like a child ready to cry. \"I did not want _you_\" she said curtly. \"Nor did they.\" Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow. He explained in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of rising temper. \"I can spare you, too,\" she whipped out; then turned to walk away, holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert but warlike. This double injustice left Rudolph chafing. In two strides, however, he had overtaken her. \"I am under orders,\" he stated grimly. Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path. This rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all former mischances, and left him far more alone. From the sultry tops of bamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of cicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as though the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry, feverish utterance. Once Mrs. Forrester looked about, quick and angry, like one ready to choke that endless voice. But for the rest, the two strange companions moved steadily onward. In an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and heavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved toward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of green fodder. Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white aliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered his blue muzzle as if to charge. There was a pause, full of menace. \"Don't run!\" said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the shoulders, thrust her behind him. She clutched him tightly by the wounded arm. The buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes. The naked boy in the green nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky sweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a command. Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the wrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow ochre. To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little child, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes from a picture immemorial in art and poetry. \"Please,\" begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip. \"Please, that hurts.\" For a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing. With a touch of contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath. Her eyes slowly gathered his meaning. \"Oh, that!\" She tore her hand loose, as though burned. \"That! It _was_ all true, then. I forgot.\" She caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her former disdain. But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be tolerated. \"What was all true?\" he insisted. \"You shall not treat me so. If anybody has a right--\" After several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:-- \"All alike, every one of you! And I was fool enough to think you were different!\" The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion. \"He told me all about it. Last evening. And you dare talk of rights, and come following me here--\" \"Lucky I did,\" retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his wounded arm, indignantly: \"That scratch, if you know how it came--\" \"I know, perfectly.\" She stared as at some crowning impudence. \"He was chicken-hearted. You came off cheaply.--I know all you said. But the one thing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he struck you, at the club. You'll always have _that_ to admire!\" \"After he struck\"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow. \"Chantel?

Oh, that liar!\" He wheeled and started to go back. \"Wait, stop!\" she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought him up short. \"They're all with him now. You can't--What did you mean?\" He explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage. \"So I couldn't even stand up to him. And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh, you need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had.\" Mrs. Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same light, impatient step. He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly turning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the friendly mischief of her eyes. \"The best?\" she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had flattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway. \"The very best friend? Don't you think you have a better?\" Rudolph stared. \"Oh, you funny, funny boy!\" she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of delight and pride. \"I hate people all prim and circumspect, and you--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all the others. That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid, lying fellow to me.\" All unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the Forrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the tiled gateway. As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on his forearm. \"So sorry.\" The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a plaintive ring. \"That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You _are_ different. This doesn't happen between people, often. When you did--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather splendid, and--like a book?\" \"It seemed nonsense,\" replied Rudolph, sturdily. \"The heat. We were fools.\" She laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously drooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy. Everywhere the cicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz. It recalled some other widespread mist of treble music, long ago. The trilling of frogs, that had been, before. \"You dear, brave boy,\" she said slowly. \"You're so honest, too. I'm not ungrateful. Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!\"_ She drew back, with an impatient gesture. \"That stupid, fat Mrs. Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you.\" The stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable appeal. \"Don't forget. Haven't you--a better friend?\" And with an instant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.                                     To his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes. He, the despised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's minion, dizzy with new honors. Nobody had ever praised him to his face. And now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and longed to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and mysterious look. On the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his big, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair. \"Hallo, Rudie! I've asked myself to tiffin,\" drawled the lounger, from a little tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah. \"How's the fair Bertha?--Mausers all right? And by the way, did you make that inventory of provisions?\" Rudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a leader. \"Yes,\" he stammered; \"I--I'll get it for you.\" He passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and for a moment stood as if dreaming. Before him the Mausers, polished and orderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall. Though appearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion. \"After all this man did for me,\" he mused. What had loosed the bond, swept away all the effects? A sound near the window made him turn. An imp in white and red livery, Peng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things violently into the outer glare. \"What thing you do?\" called Rudolph, sharply. Some small but heavy object clattered on the floor. The urchin stooped, snatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the river. He turned, grinning amiably. \"Goo-moh? ning-seh. How too you too,\" he chanted. \"I am welly? glat to-see you.\" A boat-coolie, he explained, had called this house bad names. He, Peng, threw stones. Bad man. \"Out of here, you rascal!\" Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the scampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for the stairs. \"What's wrong?\" Heywood appeared promptly at the door. From the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:-- \"Goat-men! Baby-killers!\" In the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a brief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy, scurried for his life. \"Chucked his billet,\" said Heywood, without surprise.", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwFwQlUFOcBAODnVSFWBAHl2N2ZnfOf2X0eEdEqaAoqhyEiRkgqHgWrBNQar1QbTKmgqIBywzJ7zMz/z/wzi6IG5SWKikZR9L14oqmixGhfNZJ6N4iafl8miOVnuKxu0faS9DlooQFRMFYrYWPwi1F9vj/rlNqCkrV4tcCfrwPXK4LTtjhZZQVObr7kjqGrYAIzpGaM75XGK9e1lP3FnhEgA5I4FjTLO9if4bnm6rp/urdKBNljb1Mv2NNZW2mI4xnNGooWAZo8Q+E6PE4YQr0RdoIQPYZKrO+Vb/g3+p7YismbkcjqwevHn8dV3CE5SlohuSyauE/uZqKlf4Bi7pSZEVVEdvFhxlK4zGOaUdRc8hQ3R1nFPqwvAkN9hdR12/nad54Zviyyt2GRb7b9IhOMQ7Wt4hrpmkTKHTqvfSzm4WR6j5TisIqsNkYrQkuF1dwzUOxKZ8Pr3levK4VgCQ7TzzZ1sY18rlKoWZA8soXbzn4BfrU+5ktqhoHFWieVquyEsXyFZ62QymjWi1EnzIlUWXAHk+/ssc8WBjkk+UrQ7zjoqPcv5QOp7fBc8VouXgzVCjEWj1MJo0abWSigcTqo0H/AGyM34Srf//YWkHf0p0YKvCuf4VcQBDMnaj1/lHCyQaZXxL48qdbNUX1KJ8wFhboHvF+ZqcWYt5ySvkK9pG2nS81PwSw2RzyBBHSyKR3XGp0gHcbVRKAE9pYq+nfzTr3IUqMexrvxz65QEMSm+PsbCsUaViJpe4f+iE+nWvhf6Wf6w7q9ekxjEnfbjAub1jyGHaLPIzMxjVvZcjWIucP7fZ9QNYh1BOLl3gIQox06eAlnh6/0BZLtVBYxSxbUfP+8hikt26QU6j7YRhY4R3rq3Vf8V+mtkSfBb5xZO0AHsxbOiRM9IOq8+C/8HC/hA8TxrrjGuopG7gHI4Bahz7GDSPQP1bq8bdGpYAP6zfFhbRXT4zXBBP6++A2b54jDV423Zqaylz7CBcJKmKFO8p6GQ3RJ+4OWb82hBqsXm7aob5vTmDjPj0YCm2+564rS7uln2b7Ja+AtJQas5q9Jw4kvpXvcMWkVEaq8VCsd/wFzxSPIVNtRLRrLD/G3MFfQ9OajHA7R5STtnXoBtSmBeKJvGLu2dnLzTHOzOYOxgD1KkPWGsrR5DfzAvpktixhAhxy3qV64i0tGD6y9ygLG1KOZOiGZ+UwXQT4DvS98j+Rt6khlsmOacpAj7L+XRFyo/psOpGegUfp1aRZzgX5k28Uw9mzqdd0C425dGryPxmvh7GA4ybreiGNja3v4ZUS/sMmWSC/R+qyDYD/+YuxLi9XLWjba1zlT+CWeLy1/kbr4GFxpzuT+RiY1lvgHon6hn3om1wy35dAuw45SBWdDJN+Gb3mtQiKYqG2QQsAjNQwPxm4l1Bdebme3w7SGWHjeOqZi1561GOPPjD7yFVjPPHAelXeILfZKNlUrZotkU58dcYkr5J94RcixOfZU+2uQCRbWU5D0Y61VSqbb6s6ZBjvg6IalchmYs7cYP3c91F54s7kTVfO8sY6b/EltkL2VP8I88A8iRrHbmGUwWFmJ59gDRH9ttYKanb48gkQEGsYGeH5U/KhCmYWq0AS0qWgqanPNZnItVrJNGCAWeyZaFVDIuiO/9v+JkvRE2Aofa8HN89FoMQIMp0Pd+2zlUXvlfrhYJ2joe8sPNTuNefR3nudkuLFbLYb71QFGYYpRP19lz9uXKBXTje6KPTlEptZLTiAI22Ugo9P+BPCWnuLM0/8uNrDz5SziRGQ1LNXyi7I5w7aQPCynqt9ygUYfXAct+hV3o7GTaUKfSieJCOIrdYtPMKdb5zJpnq3KNOTAJVwSW8m7UNeOC8JfqafyzdJpOAg4os5TbWKieI97WZujblOnsIP55XgDKIB3oDMyg1rDzlGQ1AVqBQuT6iMtaZUdtIwGoIOII23aU8z5J2kLxCLlFxvAB5SN0QejkrSbQSVsAU424pWfuGW+eC6WKZJaW16AYN1mXrPHRU+Hl90PtU501nnKfoD06lmerUySme0YxywCyBJgLDSgv0c4LFzEeeHX5Nt0sXoDpeIXYq+cSU1X242PxHq2mu2X7+mbtRFwt5aufK8yFocxYv8+WAwqSIL+VkjUInAoM8BaGj3ae+g4SjCv2t5Y1kGf/aAZXxfif2lJ01JHL8IdwgY1lHSRnWh2dZT6mvsB9Cm53jc+Dj+rFcyhjrryPq5ex7bD9Exue+Rm9TT9EIzTu5mnTF/051IZWGUs8cQ2hDZrRolth9bvmkHZxDNACYNUt9A65mPzO/IoOoKyGuc6puobxVfVQcJw5o+sn7is9jjGCRouV79i7pGrcbtZqh6Ldkf+RN3kL+gaHUnF0SnYg9rZevNDOZuP53YGvvKQwR1aAKiSv26ixDNMBtML4iI+EXeB+XoZGcKMcBy2dY/tM2jxEdohQfmYL5fNVf5L5ipu9hx9nZ7cEKJ7GKe3zbYYTm1e43+rPZEnApqMU1Z63zV01xQZZR4bWOfMD5tlT6/mw3JFG3fM/o0YCj8wVOG4shLusQ/AuLGpahGz3NXu2IneY9PcB4TvlXTfY1QOI+WPyP8DeFKJRw=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-cc8fec9426618ca64578c6884dce2474", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "honor bolted for the stairs. \"What's wrong?\" Heywood appeared promptly at the door.

Man,\" he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--\"man, why didn't you stop him? The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen, he's crippled us: one pair of rifles left.\" CHAPTER XIV OFF DUTY The last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western ridges. It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of field and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid, undulating grace. Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles of the village roofs patched the countryside. From the distant sea had come a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so faint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices, nor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically blue or icy with reflected clouds. Miss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her. \"This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?\" she said; then to herself, slowly, \"'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'\" Heywood made no pretense of following her look. \"'Dear Nun,'\" he blurted; \"no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that walkest with me here--'\" The girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood is frustrated. The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not, it seemed, of all. \"Your fault,\" said Heywood, impenitent. \"Merely to show you. I could quote, once.\" \"Aged Man!\" She laughed, as though glad of this turn. \"I like you better in prose. Go on, please, where we left off. What did you do then?\" Heywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded. \"Oh, that! Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put a trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned all hands to hunting. 'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two side-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three the diver got in shallow water. Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had no time for, eight. We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair shows they keep a beastly close watch.\" \"Yes,\" said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath. \"Peng was the most promising pupil we had.\" \"He was,\" stated her companion, \"a little, unmitigated, skipping, orange-tawny goblin!\" She made no reply. As they footed slowly along the winding path, Flounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of bamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs delicately stiff and joyful. Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:-- \"Poor little dog. Little Foreign Dog!\" She rose with a sigh, to add incongruously, \"Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things that happen!\" \"I don't know.\" Heywood looked at her keenly. \"Sometimes they're the same.\" The jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from knee to ankle, before he added:-- \"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.\" \"Another,\" said the girl, \"of your heathen stories?\" \"Rather a pretty one,\" he retorted. \"It happened in a seaport, a good many hundred miles up the coast. A poor girl lived there, with her mother, in a hut. One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was anxious. Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm. The girl lay there in the dark. Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western story; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were at stake. So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest. And then it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through the storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid. She had become larger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the whole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took one in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.

Just retrieved 'em, you know. But then across the storm she heard her mother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer. So she lost that junk.\" \"Well, then her spirit was back in the hut. But next day the two junks came in; the third one, never. And for that dream, she was made, after her death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven.\" As Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town, but hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled. \"You told that,\" said Miss Drake, \"as though it had really happened.\" \"If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none.\" His gesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side. Miss Drake looked back toward the hills. \"Her dream was play, compared to--some.\" \"That,\" he answered, \"is abominably true.\" The curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly. In her dark eyes there was no impatience, but only trouble. \"We do better,\" she said, \"when we are both busy.\" He nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as to the silence which followed. The evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even the village streets. Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of the day went on as quiet as a summer cloud. Meeting or overtaking, coolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous flags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and creaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot. The yellow muscles rippled strongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes intent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the call and answer which make burdens lighter:-- \"O heh!--O ha?  O ho ho!  O heh!--O ha?  O ho ho!\" From hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a cobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge. Yet everywhere the slow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky red tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued white and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming vesper light. Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their gossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and blinking gravely. Above them, no less courteous and placid, little doorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth within. Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small stone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of misfortune. But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored of the Influences. In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying, joking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people. A plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat basket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly. \"See the two boats going by!\" she called. \"Her feet are bigger than my Golden Lilies!\" And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong, free, and perfect in modeling. An old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a tree. \"Their women,\" he growled, \"are shameless, and walk everywhere!\" But a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned him down. \"She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses,\" he declared. \"Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!\" Then bending over the cage, with solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark. As Heywood and the girl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely. \"I give my pet his airing,\" he said; and then, quickly but quietly, \"When you reach the town, do not pass through the West Quarter. It is full of evil-minded persons. Their placards are posted.\" A shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer grasshoppers for sale. \"We have seen no placards,\" replied Heywood. \"You will to-morrow,\" said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting, became engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished splints of the cage. \"Maker of Music, here is your evening rice.\" The two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel. \"You see,\" Heywood broke out. \"Warnings everywhere. Now please, won't you listen to my advice? No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but when it does--\" \"I can't run away.\" She spoke as one clinging to a former answer. \"I must stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is.\" He eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more. For a moment they halted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part luminous with golden dust. A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously with flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true and lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet. Beyond, their tiny juniors, girls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all hand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again, in the dizzy graces of the \"Water Wheel.\"", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c4b2ed94cb6730b5bd6ce1da0c824c42", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "market-place, part shade, part luminous with golden dust. A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously with flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true and lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet. Beyond, their tiny juniors, girls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all hand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again, in the dizzy graces of the \"Water Wheel.\" Other boys, and girls still trousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among shoes that lay across the road. All traffic, even the steady trotting coolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout. \"Lucky Hand, Lucky Hand! Allow me to pass,\" begged a coffin-maker's man, bent under a plank. \"These Long-Life boards are heavy.\" \"Ho, Lame Chicken!\" called another, blocked by the hop-scotch. He was a brown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that buzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield. \"Ho, Lame Chicken! Do not bump me. They will sting.\" He came through safely; for at the same moment the musical \"Cling-clank\" of a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race. The way was clear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of an \"Exalted Literary Society,\" and plodding, between two great baskets, on his pious rounds. \"Revere and spare,\" he piped, at intervals,-- \"revere and spare the Written Word!\" All the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after they had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path. In the hoary peace of twilight,-- \"What can _we_ do here?\" the girl cried abruptly. \"There--I never meant to say it. But it runs in my head all the time. I work and work, to keep it down. What can we do here?\" Heywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly cut in the failing light. Were there only pride in those fine and resolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or medal of victory. \"You work too hard,\" he said. \"Think, instead, of all the good--\" But at that she seemed to wince. \"The good? As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at home! Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!\" She spoke quietly, with a kind of wonder. \"Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them for--for something too great and mysterious. It's all very strange to look back on, and try to put into words. I remember painted glass, and solemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible world--and its Maker and Master.\" She looked down the dusky lanes, where glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink. \"Oh, this land! where you see the days running into years!\" \"The Dragon's a wise old beast,\" he ventured. \"He teaches--something.\" She assented gravely:-- \"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.\" \"There are no dark continents,\" declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken voice. \"The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never see into it--\" \"Don't!\" she cried sharply. \"What did we promise?\" They stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them both. \"I forgot--I couldn't help\"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled forward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready. \"Mustn't get to fussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you know. The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk, and Flounce with you. I swam like anything, miles and miles, but couldn't get out to you. Worked like steam, and no headway. Flounce knew I was coming, but you didn't. Deuced odd, how real it seemed.\" She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger. \"And speaking of dragons,\" she rejoined. \"They _do_ help. The man in the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable.\" \"Oh?\" He stood plainly at a loss. \"Oh, I see. German, wasn't he?--Pity they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!\" Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not said:-- \"Your mind works very slowly.\" \"Oh?\" Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered cheerfully: \"Dare say. Always did. Thought at first you meant the rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra.\" The gate of the town yawned black. From the streets glimmered a few lanterns, like candles in a long cave. But shunning these unfriendly corridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the dim ways of an outlying hamlet. A prolonged shriek of growing fright and anguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the great carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a chamber of horrors.

In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most familiar things became grotesque. A woman's voice telling stories behind shadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her lighted screen, had the effect of incantation. Before the booth of a dentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow, rattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals. And from a squat den--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the words \"Foreign Earth,\" and the guttering door-lantern hinted \"As You Like It\"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more poisonous than mere opium. \"Let's go faster,\" said the girl. \"Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy to-night.\" Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw against a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with orange squares. Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered here and there by twos and threes, and dispersed. Cackling argument came from the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of the wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet. Both pillars of the gate were plastered with them. \"Placards,\" said Heywood. \"Things are ripening fast.\" Lighting match from match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of symbols. He read them off slowly. 'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw! that's a theatre notice: enterprising manager.--Ah, more like it. Long preamble, regular trimetrical platitudes--here we are:-- \"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral tablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one finger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the False Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the mind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese lead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining ninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost. This silver can be extracted only by the elixir of black eyes. The green eyes of barbarians are of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure. But here's the close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population. Patriots, join! Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans, to take their place among the strange things of creation!'\" \"And the big characters,\" she added, \"the big characters you tried to hide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?\" Gray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening the blood in his fingers, slowly burned out. CHAPTER XV KAU FAI At the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward ceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might use in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man. Heywood laughed, without mercy, at this pious fraud. \"Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!\" he cried. \"We came early--straight from our walk. Are the rest coming? And did my cook arrive to help yours?\" Their host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful. \"The cook is here,\" he replied, \"by the kitchen-sounds. They disagree, I think. I have asked everybody. We should have a full dinner-table.\" \"Good,\" said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss Drake to the living-room, \"I say, don't act as though you expected the ghost of Banquo.\" In the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some long and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true forbearance. Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued. The story was forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking light of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting solemnity before meat, but a period of tension. The relief came oddly. Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the tramp of feet, and loud halloos. \"By Jove!\" cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all his bulk, he was first at the window. A straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging and crowding to a halt under the walls. Yellow faces gleamed faintly, bare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting. Among the vanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue. \"_Burra suar!_\" it raged; then hailed imperiously, \"_Ko hai?_\" Where the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white waved a helmet, crying,-- \"On deck! Where the devil does Maurice Heywood live?\" \"I'm up here,\" called that young man. For reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his white legs like a dancing marionette. Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he sent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall. \"Here we come!\" he shouted, in hilarious warning. The squabbling retinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns disappeared under the covered way. \"It's the captain!\" laughed Heywood, in amazement. \"Kneebone--ashore! He can't be sober!\" All stared;", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN0AdXFVcCAGAxWLCLdF+Zcu/MnQGEtXDUWEAxNtTYiDHJyVpQczSKNboqUYkmwYgUQR7vDW/63DvvKW50gygWLHjWvrFFV1HXgi0WDLYYXH/C900VVOBX61SW7YqviQdQta9SypZNTtEWUF6rhaWaSSDfTPMcxKPwJOot09LISSwL7Y/TyTKXj3viuwuiOuxkFNJSZ+CF7Z9oVxyXqVGkmV+oY9dw62YwP9LffTbd1bmGZoyflb0wyhmBQkBmyXP6DPR7u1gLcYGQwuQLLcU55t988yhaeRu8W1EteSVCebXnpH/yRvyYFdSJvnG+YNxYhOQR4N+OWnSeP0w2GHlUV2EL+Z2+ZTQFsiGiYp1zjUKm2n0Sphofo5cFPfUN+sPNY4UcY9vmDrCcD+LdpEd8ubIp4iH4zEy2rgs55n56OPVSSECSD+pzYYG4EQahEDPPnaZ8pDiUU8JRPNv9EfgNdkCckYtHST201U4PesjNZrvySL8CSs1xjknU8R9WcX34tvAQPFuaoXrsZP6NP6miS0JONwnZaJP7jH+bJ0OYESwFTe776nM4iD8n/kUOGfeEzvActQzzetsyM3q4EWGkc5F4AdVH98B1xrd4tGOwKqAwboq0z19JT9KLnINJqpjnTPRP9bWNrlRSpG60S0kWl6vzaTawL2E1+Y88ACe4NfwSpHN9xXTmA1xPNdrF5HPxvP4NPc94AKvN59J1/qQcrWfg7zXD3C7lUc+odsEId4zYwtWRusvJ5l1wg8ugU6lQ+zf5qRUh10l51rHcmkA6WmJHwA3F1Xof9NhaAXojj7eePSx3iw/BM9li8Ty+vSPbrKIXxT2KOO/Lg7vksC2tgvXq2MpZ8oYoL+rLsQkZ0hCu7bbd0EZZ8ZkgTN1FJzsmczXka26e8Tq+1mpt9+P28su1Y+6Nrl3gCzBQ3KrOD2S4V9qi7i3Zqq7jXKbJjNZGgR3u+SgJqjzPnxDDcHTwDrllqMI0JlA+ECexAeOqsrS0El81Z3AVLPTU+ZKt8cEn7Gp6HznvzpRbuXLNuXYDjE+J0VhrCRjqOOKsk0RLLFnudlJZ4KX/MvoCXBbPGTVKqP6O+pG5QShQajwNNAisxy56ZKTo/fDa7o8sRXUqSuz0YF97H3ZI6L1pD1sY+2vwotYEs6kkZqbWIKyVDuAJSogRIydKq/098UUmUjRgNHHSewA08k2HtSefL9kiWOpJmBL994oJrvZKqjJMy1A/NO4zQ8FFKosehJa4X3KD5G/9dVu/UeKNFKUETpYT3dtJAjvWjWEdrOJHxC2OSbTSNu1Ux5GHkVeKDzv3ORs71YsF/JXCV7FS2QZ4hETYzZFr6RdSiv3QF+nKtuZ3XyxtBeEBUXuHaKUO+suuyl8KZ9BMPFCO40w/9vUhaeSMUq4ncf8wSoGq7XYD5yXnMb2K+LCPO8svYi/Gr9cq+Z3rs/gnyjvO5ehJPqQnoQvsZDNDsdidIfXwBFyA9sp75UWkv/dqzDm2Wod4ABiRsES5p70WSrG3bCI1Rp3AZtJDaafEidPplvhI10fcU9pt7/dkKBr4U59hJNkrmImony+GUIGatj35IdY97aJQol5Tt5gpxgldNkJMJi7NV7TJA8qpL5XxqDi0TMspyYJDnTdiFfsZPIQ1dZo8wOpMOpNToCT+FTvQmioPkRsiis2u2tqoT11b3L0IT7pzIu4VYZJw8kSZor6S4tlmfamYzB8NDC476GjPPmDGK5OIR89UakA16kjPwjVwtP+fYinej2ZxLu4zeN/daISSvE7Xo37XF3LbPKPoLCEbL8IhWhieWDbE/gOFy2UW4tK9F62DxftJUdz3FU1xefJAnEu6CHHolGOk0eD5WWzv/LwinF1p3BHegkL0h7hZvMbMAU3GGbOAeSP0NNvw2SZSx4BaMALo/ttKD5TEjUXjwbLyRnkY2CC/wieo9ihff2xUWfXqXe6stkd+p+OYKc4XoNm8D78zc7BR4dWn8YkuGxCKLT1d6RdsuZVdSm/unmou18vLVEtJaCj4BX1tL/PUdpRIuZDGNPIjQbilkTY2i/5EVOBCRK08TCgp2OJg8TEhEzfDcm944C/UmqsGR6TeJIZkq0eMT/GPcW4m1K7aDqzWKDX2Ab1KuGcMs9bAHeIl05ZB1A/ma2w6i8ANdaW/NgDVA2S4fttK5F6Y84WflKfwv752Ubq3XcU0VIlUXwujxOxr7pZf2U/EoF7FRVf8K7qWv8m8pMKV50w6r8q/0N/RJ+AdkiJMwVNgs2+Hfcw8DpeQpfJ0ulq8wyX5vwIwfpdfCMreQrWNMjKqm7DQaBSCsAs7hl3tn+NJNJh4QRypt/Frwml5P95EppYb7tnqT/5n4Fd5lRwOljCmGWbsAjWB1u4d/MdUJ9+b9xv9zf+xl/xuHSc8Bbti7qNVZoW4GFSTa+zZGIKOelVmfPAmOmtguqksIaKemwV6gXyc8P5rPdvfLCElwG0VO656e2/rZedaM11S9HRY6O0Um6emy7dw79JcZmrCV541cfHOO/7fxSA6zswUNmmLyAV+hplhfQCSqHVmlTRUmMCvEGYY5a7TljNxjDm+aBr+RFXfD/8fMl2RDQ=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-aa2a11d0d00386af1ab3eca8d4d59492", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "white legs like a dancing marionette. Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he sent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall. \"Here we come!\" he shouted, in hilarious warning. The squabbling retinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns disappeared under the covered way. \"It's the captain!\" laughed Heywood, in amazement. \"Kneebone--ashore! He can't be sober!\" All stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and outspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port. The two young men hurried to the stairs. Chinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and still came straggling in at the gate. By the noise and clatter, it might have been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder. Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles, boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects. Among them, still brawling in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders. At sight of Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant grimaces. By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever. \"I've come to stay a month!\" he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's hands and whirled him about. \"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy! And here we are, at last!\" Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was beyond question sober. Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an anxious glance. \"Good! but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery,\" said the one; and the other added, \"You're just in time for dinner.\" The captain found these facts to be excruciating. He clapped Rudolph on the arm, and crowed:-- \"Nunnery? We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged! A banquet. What's more, I've brought the chow\"--he swept the huddled boxes with a prodigal gesture,--\"lashin's o' food and drink! That's what it is: a banquet!\" He turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a handful of silver, crying, \"_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with ye! _Jao_, ye beggars! Not a pice more. Finish! I'll not spend it all on _you_!\" Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a ferocious kick. \"Stores? The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong! Look here\"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: \"Chow de Bruxelles, what? Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye? French, my boy. Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French.\" Heywood lost his worried frown. Something had happened,--evidently at Calcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he dropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the effect of heat or loneliness. \"What's up, Captain?\" he laughed. But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy, staving open boxes right and left. A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a hissing froth of champagne. \"Plenty more,\" he cried, rejoicing. \"That shows ye how much _I_ care! Oho!\" Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood, began mysteriously to exult over him. \"Old fool and his earnings, eh? Fixed ideas, eh? 'No good,' says you. 'That cock won't fight,' says you. 'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho! What price fixed ideas now?\" The eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief. \"No,\" he cried, with a start: \"you haven't?\" The captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a Roman stateliness. \"I have.\" He nodded solemnly. \"Bar sells, I have. No more, now. We'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet! Announce, that's the word. First time in _my_ life: announce!\" Heywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject silence. \"Awfully glad, old chap,\" he at last contrived to say, and again choked. The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular, benign, and fatherly smile. \"A funny world, ain't it?\" he declared sagely. \"I've known this boy a long time,\" he explained to Rudolph. \"This matter's--We'll let you in, presently. Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my banquet. Eh? You don't care? Once in a bloomin' lifetime.\" With a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants' quarters. A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the \"learn-pidgin\" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the court; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud confusion of orders and miscomprehension.

The captain's dinner was the more brilliant. Throughout the long, white room, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft and tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown sisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such profusion of viands, or of talk and laughter. The Saigon stores--after daily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury. The captain's wine proved excellent. And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of the table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin. His quick blue eyes danced with the light of some ineffable joke. He seemed a conjurer, creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness. \"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\" Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was beside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a sidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and entrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat. Never before had Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her presence vibrated so near. Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face glowing red above the candles. Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of bounties, and looked expectantly toward their source. The captain cleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once, hung his head. \"Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all,\" he grumbled; and wheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been defrauded: \"Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk, and now it's all gone!\" He stared at his plate miserably. It was Miss Drake who came to his rescue. \"Tell us the secret,\" she begged. \"How do you manage all these nice things?\" The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the bright table, then returned to her, gratefully:-- \"This ain't anything. Only a little--bloomin'--\" \"Impromptu,\" suggested Heywood. \"That's the word!\" Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor. \"That's it, ye know. I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw, picking up these impromptus. But I came here all the way to break the news proper, by word o' mouth.\" He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,-- \"I'm rich,\" he declared. \"I'm da--I'm remarkable rich.\" Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory. \"It ain't for me to boast. Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save money. But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the money's safe to my credit at the H.K. and S. in Calcutta, and I'm retired and going Home! More money than the old Kut Sing earned since her launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep! And me without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live luxurious ever after!\" \"Ow!\" cried Nesbit, \"lucky beggar!\"--\"Sincerely glad,\" said Mr. Forrester. And a volley of compliments went round the board. The captain plainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good will, stood now at ease, chuckling. \"Most men,\" he began, when there came a lull, \"most men makes a will after they're dead. That's a shore way o' doing things! Now _I_ want to see the effects, living. So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper. To Miss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees.\" In the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed. \"What shall I say?\" she whispered, wavering between amusement and distress. \"I can't accept it--\" \"Nonsense!\" grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance. \"Don't spoil the happiest evening of an old man's life.\" \"You're right,\" she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she thanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him duck and grin,--a proud little benefactor. \"That ain't all,\" he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger, like a pistol, at her neighbor. \"Who poked fun at me, first and last? Who always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was? Fixed ideas, eh? No go?--Look you here. What did I come so many hundred miles for? To say what I always said: half-shares.\" The light-blue eyes, keen with sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an indescribable change. \"My boy, the half's yours. There's two rich men here to-night. I've come to take you Home.\" It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb. He grew very pale. \"Oh, I say,\" he stammered at last, \"it's", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-68888bb43a75a4c144e123dadcb3dd1e", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "I come so many hundred miles for?

There's two rich men here to-night. I've come to take you Home.\" It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb. He grew very pale. \"Oh, I say,\" he stammered at last, \"it's not fair--\" \"Don't spoil the happiest evening--\" whispered the girl beside him. He eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the head of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word to say. \"Can do, can do,\" said Captain Kneebone, curtly. \"I was afraid ye might not want to come.\" Then followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache bristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening sentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white, with such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the melancholy \"boy\" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver casket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul. As the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs. Forrester make an angry signal. And presently, like a prisoner going to his judge, Chantel slipped out of the room. He was not missed; for already the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor was it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full glass aloft. \"Here,\" he cried in triumph, \"here's to every nail in the hoof--\" The glass crashed into splinters and froth. A flying stone struck the boom of the punkah, and thumped on the table. Through the open windows, from the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many voices in the distance. \"Shutters!\" called Heywood. \"Quick!\" As they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and clattered against the wall. Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an unaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a formidable silence. While the banqueters listened in the smoky room, there came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and very slack bass-drum. \"_Kau fai!_\" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as though hurrying off toward the sound,--\"_kau fai!_\" \"The Black Dog,\" said Heywood, quietly. \"He has barked. Earlier than we figured, Gilly. Lucky the scaffolding's up. Gentlemen, we all know our posts. Guns are in the first bedroom. Quietly, now. Rudie, go call Chantel. Don't frighten the women. If they ask about that noise, tell 'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning. Anything.--We can easily hold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship.\" The captain wheeled, with an injured air. \"What ship?\" he inquired testily. \"Told ye, plain, I was retired. Came the last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now. Think I carry ships in my pocket?\" Outside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse calling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through the darkness. CHAPTER XVI THE GUNWALE Rudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward recalled as incredibly peaceful. Two of the women, at least, showed no fear. In the living-room sat Mrs. Earle, her chin cramped on her high bosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the Rhine. Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him, saying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs. Forrester had gone down to the garden. In the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern. The compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that the pair were not in the garden. \"Walkee so.\" He pointed down the passage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to indicate their course. \"Makee finish, makee die now,\" he added calmly; \"too muchee, no can.\" Rudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the scalp. They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept away in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood transfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of helplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight, darted down the covered way. The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in a saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a gnome in the gallery of a mine. Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the heavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.

Not all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the shapes which rushed behind him in his flight. Wheeling once, he saw two broad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from Heywood's house, one from the club. He caught also a whirling impression of many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing disorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout, a single word, like \"_Sha, sha_!\" repeated incessantly in a high key. The flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious criss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like fiery tadpoles through a net. He turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose on hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin, rough cloth, warm and sopping. In a nausea of relief, he felt that this was a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard. Rudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he and she had traversed at noon. Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped short violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him, wrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic. He kicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free, with a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible. Stranger still, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he missed the sharp music of her cicadas. The looming of a wall checked him. Here stood her house; she had the briefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way; by all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right path: why, then, had he not overtaken her? If she met that band which he had just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning wildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her window. He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf, stumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and went falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in his life,--\"Bertha! Bertha!\" Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered. At last, however, reaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door, two figures struggling. Just before he entered, she tore herself free and went unsteadily across the room. Chantel, white and abject, turned as in panic. \"Oh!\" Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his own. Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but his staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution. \"Help me with her,\" he begged. \"She won't listen. The woman's out of her wits.\" He caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close friends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction. She ransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the contents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese silver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild heap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre earnings had been squandered. A Cingalese box dropped and burst open, scattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast. She trampled them in her blind and furious search. \"Come,\" said Chantel, and snatched at her. \"Leave those. Come to the boat. Every minute--\" She pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped again among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for the sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank, dilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd. \"Rudolph,\" she whimpered, \"help me. What shall I do?\" Without waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her pitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands. Rudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better. \"We must humor her,\" whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler among the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and brown, painted with men and buffaloes. On this he began to heap things pell-mell. The woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph, hiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of her strength. \"Come, he'll bring them,\" she sobbed. \"Let's go--to the boat. He must find his own way. Take me.\" Hurry and fright choked her. \"Take me--leave him, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and we ran--\" \"What boat?\" said Rudolph. Chantel did not look up. \"I have one ready and stocked,\" he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at the knot in the sarong corners. \"You can come. We'll drop down the river, and try it along the coast. Only chance. Come on.\" He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle over his shoulder. \"Come on,\" he snarled. Against the gay pattern, his handsome pirate face shone", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bfccb23dd43d27cfb79137b943a1e1f1", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "boat?\" said Rudolph. Chantel did not look up. \"I have one ready and stocked,\" he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at the knot in the sarong corners. \"You can come. We'll drop down the river, and try it along the coast. Only chance. Come on.\" He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle over his shoulder. \"Come on,\" he snarled. Against the gay pattern, his handsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight. \"Damn you, I've waited long enough for your whims. Stay there and be killed, then.\" He ran to the stairs, and down. The woman's arms began to drag loosely, as if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she turned and bolted. Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till she had caught Chantel at the gate. All three, silent, sped across fields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange glow from distant flames. The rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud. Behind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them, still more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe. Through the mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern gleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the thin, slant line that was his pole. \"Lowdah?\" called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as the boatman answered. Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and leapt on board. Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman, who lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion. He felt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange, breathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which tempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river. He lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung to his hands. \"Aboard! Quickly!\" snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the lantern. Obeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale. The slippery edge, polished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality in this dream, except the warmth of her hands. \"To the nunnery?\" he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination. \"No, no,\" she wailed. \"Down--away--safe.\" \"No, back to them,\" he answered stupidly. \"They are all there. Your--he is there. We can't leave--\" \"You fool!\" Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the boatman--\"Shove off, if they won't come!\" He seized the woman roughly and pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's hand again. \"Come, hurry,\" she whispered, tugging at him. \"Come, dear boy. I won't leave you. Quickly. You saw it burning. They're all dead. It's no use. We must live. We must live, darling.\" She was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her. He must come with her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames. She and life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an impossible duty, and death. His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky lantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong. It meant nothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had concentrated in a single vision, it meant everything. The  cloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held all her treasure and her heart, the things of this world. She must go with those. It was fitting. She was beautiful--in all her fear and disorder, still more beautiful. She went with life, departing into a dream. This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the sole reality, a shining line between life and death. \"Then I must die,\" he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that perilous boundary. He vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern and slash down at him with the lowdah's pole. The bamboo struck him, heavy but glancing, on the head. He staggered, lost his footing, and fell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken him, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off into the darkness. By and by it was gone. From somewhere in another direction came a sharp, continual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints in a fire. The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt gunpowder. But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were dry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears, and that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no longer watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of flowing water.

Without turning, he heard a man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause and stoop close. When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes, he saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie. Quite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in German. It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that finally fretted him into listening. The words did not concern him. \"Are you dead, then?\" grumbled the coolie. \"Did she kill you?\" Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion. Some time afterward the same voice came louder. The coolie was still there. \"You cannot sit here all night,\" he said. \"By daylight they will catch you. Come. Perhaps I can take you to your friends. Come.\" Rudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could rebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid. He choked, swallowed, and presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river. \"_Stoesst an_!\" said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of women. \"Is that not better?\" The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found himself afoot and awake. A dizzy warmth cleared his spirit. He understood perfectly. This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland. He and his nauseous alien brandy had restored the future. There was more to do. \"Come on.\" The forsaken lover was first man up the bank. \"See!\" he cried, pointing to a new flare in the distance. The whole region was now aglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a continuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk. \"Her house is burning now.\" \"You left in time.\" Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a lean and exhausted laborer. \"I was with the men you fought, when you ran. I followed to the house, and then here, to the river. I was glad you did not jump on board.\" He glanced back, timidly, for approbation. \"I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay and help.\" He steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging in a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind trees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker, crept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames. When the quaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings dangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of smoke. They coughed as they ran. Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks. \"The nunnery is burning,\" he said hopelessly. His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened. \"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting the uproar. At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks, Rudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came stumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles. Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered. \"Hide here, and wait,\" commanded Wutzler. \"I will go see.\" And he flitted off through the smoke. Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting. Shapes of men ran past, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang overhead like a vibrating wire. Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling through the huddled pottery. \"Lie still,\" he whispered. \"Your friends are hemmed in. You cannot get through.\" The smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without coughing, and could rest their smarting eyes. In the midst of tumult and combustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool. Along its rim bristled a scrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud. After a time, something still blacker parted the weeds. In silhouette, a man's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained there as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the act of spying. CHAPTER XVII LAMP OF HEAVEN The white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty Thieves. They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black head lodged there without stirring. The watcher, whether he had seen them or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he held a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as though he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing or waking, as the humor prompted. Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling heat. The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress. His legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs. He felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss. This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan. \"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward,", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-55920e580ffbe8f30568a68484ac0df2", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "if to break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs.

This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan. \"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward, inch by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained the further darkness. So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no more than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge, against the rosy cloud. From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees, and silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit. Once, through a rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind some ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause or care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a glance behind. Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans or scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids. Passing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow. In spite of smoke, he had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the man's legs. Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the <DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket beside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement. He seemed ready to spring up and fire. No time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with a painful, giddy exactness. He would have counted to himself before leaping, but his throat was too dry. He flinched a little, then shot through the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the fellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat. Almost in the same movement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his head, as high as he could withdraw them. The body among the weeds lay cold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same tense attitude, which had nothing to do with life. Rudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal discourtesy. Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully up the bank. \"You have killed him?\" quavered the dry little voice. \"You are very brave!\" \"No, no,\" cried Rudolph, earnestly. \"He was, already.\" By the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket, the man at their feet was one of the musketeers. He had left the firing-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in. \"So! This is good luck!\" Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his jacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead man, began to untwist the scarlet turban. In the dim light his lean arms and frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape robbing a sleeper. He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the blood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod, powder-horn, and bag of bullets.--\"Now I am all safe,\" he chuckled. \"Now I can go anywhere, to-night.\" He shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were ended. \"So! I am rebel soldier. We try again; come.--Not too close behind me; and if I speak, run back.\" In this order they began once more to scout through the smoke. No one met them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to each other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of smoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the wrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of gongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that sputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red gold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters. Where and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as they ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the heart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a stone's throw from his own gate. It was amazing to feel that safety lay so close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging in the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no disturbance that evening. Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he wondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and why, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely to dig clay. He had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred hieroglyphic on his guide's jacket.

Here they are!--To your left!\" And with the words, he bounded off to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase. Rudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had doubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered close by him in the smoke. Before him gaped a black square, through which he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk. As he rose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had fallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his own, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery. With high hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness. Once, among the bales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away. With no time to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps, groping toward the other door. He had nearly reached it, when torchlight flared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and guttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse. He had barely time, in the reeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin curtain of reeds to a new refuge. Into this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips, umbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds. Lying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the gauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men who shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the bales, to probe the darkness. Their search was wild but thorough. Before it, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room, brushing the splint partition like a snake. This, as Rudolph guessed, might be the man whose hand he had stepped on. The stitches in the curtain became beads of light. A shadowy arm heaved up, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash. A sword had cut the reeds from top to bottom. Through the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after both, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat. Rudolph, half wrapped in his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their narrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell resounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the flambeau, and the sword were snatched away. He lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril. They had caught the crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights. Through the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an empty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling, and prodding him with their pikes. Some jeered, some snarled, others called him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or at least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down question after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an inquisition. At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his knees and faced them boldly. A haggard Christian, he was being fairly given his last chance to recant. \"Open your mouth! Open your mouth!\" they cried, in rage or entreaty. The kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct and simple. \"Open your mouth!\" They struck at him with the torches. The same sword that had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest. Rudolph, clenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all these men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the past, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy. The kneeling man repeated his unknown declaration. His round, honest, oily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring light. He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound his queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers moved surely and deftly. Not once did they slip or tremble. \"Open your mouth!\" snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the fierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience. \"The Lamp of Heaven!\" bawled the swordsman, beside himself. \"Give him the Lamp of Heaven!\" To the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder. \"Good! good!\" they shrilled, nodding furiously. \"The Lamp of Heaven!\" And several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down. Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores to the nunnery. But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a sack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum. The sword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough. \"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\" For a second the Christian did not stir. Then, as though the option were not in his power,-- \"Die,\" he answered. The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-495c1c68ae456761e6ffabfb88b22fb3", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "across and punctured the tin, than a fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough. \"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\" For a second the Christian did not stir. Then, as though the option were not in his power,-- \"Die,\" he answered. The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless gray turban of dough. Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of lighting it. The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single cry, clear above all the others. He was calling--as even Rudolph knew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the West, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant. Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and fall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the general din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots. Splinters flew from the attap walls. A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun half round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken wrestlers. The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and diving over bales. On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed that its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of humility. Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the complete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or domestic, new or old. With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found the side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane. He knew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed, and step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when something from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the ground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended. His own friends: they might miss him once, but not twice. Let it come quickly. Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever known,--a keen, high voice, scolding. \"What the devil are you firing at?\" It was Heywood, somewhere on the roof of the pony-shed. He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and cheerful. \"A shadow? Rot! You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take your gun away. Remember that!\" Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection. \"Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down 's afire.\" \"Saves us the trouble of burning it.\" The other voice moved away, with a parting rebuke. \"No more of that, sniping and squandering. Wait till they rush you.\" Rudolph lifted his head from the dust. \"Maurice!\" he called feebly. \"Maurice, let me in!\" \"Hallo!\" answered his captain on the wall, blithely. \"Steady on, we'll get you.\" Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable. Then a bight of rope fell across Rudolph's back. He seized it, hauled taut, and planting his feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row of sand-bags. \"Ho, you wandering German!\" His invisible friend clapped him on the shoulder. \"By Jove, I'm glad. No time to burble now, though. Off with you. Compradore has a gun for you, in the court. Collect a drink as you go by. Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner. Danger point there: we need a good man, so hurry. Devilish glad. Cut along.\" Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound with his head in a whirl. Yet through all the scudding darkness and confusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star. On this night of alarms, he had turned the great corner in his life. Like the pale stranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course. He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught from any earthly cup. Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger. CHAPTER XVIII SIEGE He never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a minute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar. Bullets spattered sharply along the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an indescribable whistling and jingling. The angle was like the prow of a ship cutting forward into a gale. Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the short bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such haste, so long ago, that afternoon. His high spirits went before a fall. As he stood up, in the full glow from the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw him head first on the sand-bags. \"How many times must I give me orders?\" barked the little sea-captain. \"Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below, ye gallivanting--Oh! it's you, is it? Well, there's your port-hole.\" A stubby finger pointed in the obscurity. \"There! and don't ye fire till I say so!\" Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran the muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come out of the qu", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1c3e181a56877f38400ce12e934ff548", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "sea-captain. \"Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below, ye gallivanting--Oh! it's you, is it?

Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling cloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder. It was strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to moment. No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub. He himself lay there unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the platform. At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal for the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack bass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off. Yet even then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry, but only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling. \"Copper cash,\" declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull. By the sound, he was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level of the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself inordinately. \"What a jolly good piece of luck! Scrap metal and copper cash. Firing money at us--like you, Captain. Just what we thought, too. Some unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters. Tonight was premature. The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else. So far.\" Rudolph listened in wonder. Here, in the thick of the fight, was a light-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news from chaos. \"Look out for arrows,\" continued the speaker, as he crawled to a loophole between Rudolph's and the captain's. \"They're shooting arrows up over. Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate. They can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though.\" And again he added, cheerfully, \"So far, at least.\" The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke, listening through the noise. The Black Dog barked again, and sent a shower of money clinking along the wall. \"How do you like it, Rudie?\" chuckled his friend. \"It is terrible,\" answered Rudolph, honestly. \"Terrible racket, yes. Fireworks, to frighten us. Wait till their ammunition comes; then you'll see fun. Fireworks, all this.\" Heywood turned to his other companion. \"I say, Kneebone, what's your idea? Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?\" The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and appeared to sniff the smoke judicially. \"They get a chance at us, more like!\" he grumbled. \"My opinion, the blighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin' delusion o' grandeur, that's what. Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night, once--maybe twice. We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down to starve us, right and proper.\" \"Siege,\" assented Heywood. \"Siege, like you read about.\" The captain lay flat again. \"Wish a man could smoke up here.\" Heywood laughed, and turned his head:-- \"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?\" \"Nothing,\" Rudolph confessed. \"Nor I, worse luck. Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of thing. However,\" he went on cheerfully, \"we shall before long\"--He broke off with a start. \"Rudie! By Jove, I forgot! Did you find them? Where's Bertha Forrester?\" \"Gone,\" said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late adventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare to suggest the magnitude of his decision. \"They went,\" he began, \"in a boat--\" He was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice of keen satisfaction, \"Here they come! I told ye!\"--and fired his rifle. Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept a ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet nightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling. One of the foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his own length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between the sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled sidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking arms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster. Among and above them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of scaling-ladders and notched bamboos. Two naked men, swinging between them a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on into the dark below the wall. \"Pung-dongs!\" bawled the captain. \"Look out for the pung-dong!\" His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below. Rudolph, fumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump his forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1d03004a9213b673458ba0acafe4309f", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "notched bamboos. Two naked men, swinging between them a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on into the dark below the wall. \"Pung-dongs!\" bawled the captain. \"Look out for the pung-dong!\" His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below. Rudolph, fumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump his forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and without time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the climber's face. The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform, but the man vanished like a shade. \"Very neat,\" growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great shove, managed to fling down the ladder. \"Perfectly silly attack. We'll hold 'em.\" While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped the platform. The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal sputtering at one end, a burning fuse. Heywood snatched at it and missed. Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his feet, swung it aloft. Firelight showed the bristling moustache of Kempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with rings of leather or metal. He threw it out with his utmost force, staggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his tall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no sooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for another of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and the night. By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life. Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads. As he fell, it was empty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a sound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot chemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron faces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire and powder-horns bursting at their sides. Dim figures scampered off, up the rising ground. \"That's over,\" panted Heywood. \"Thundering good lesson,--Here, count noses. Rudie? Right-oh. Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain? Good! but look sharp, while I go inspect.\" He whispered to Rudolph. \"Come down, won't you, and help me with--you know.\" At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in what might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon. \"Is Hackh there?\" He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat, \"Where is she? Where's my wife?\" It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on the ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had chosen. The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of them. His questioner stood very still. It was like telling the news of an absent ghost to another present. \"This town was never a place,\" said Gilly, with all his former steadiness,--\"never a place to bring a woman. And--and of her age.\" All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the shouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll. All three, as it seemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile. \"That's all I wanted to know,\" said the older man, slowly. \"I must get back to my post. You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here? Well, that's--that's lucky. I'll go back.\" For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood spoke:-- \"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?\" \"Oh, yes,\" replied Forrester, rousing slightly. \"All quiet there. No more arrows. Converts behaving splendidly. Two or three have begged for guns.\" \"Give 'em this.\" Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle. \"And this belt--Kempner's. Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return them.--Anything else?\" \"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into the darkness. \"No, except \"--He halted. \"Except if we come to a pinch, and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance. Won't you? I could do better, now, than--than you younger men. Oh, and Hackh; your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel immensely grateful.\" He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about such gratitude. \"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their feet. \"Don't stand looking. Can't be helped. Trust old Gilly to take it like a man. Come bear a hand.\" And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would offend no more by speaking.

When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in turn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also, like an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow. To ears long deafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never heard before. Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from top to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by some unholy constraint. Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale disk of the moon dissolved in light. The convex field stood bare, except for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog thrust his round muzzle. In a truce of empty silence, the defenders slept by turns among the sand-bags. The day came, and dragged by without incident. The sun blazed in the compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon. At the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that now lay scattered along the path. One of these a workman suddenly caught at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre. The head was blunt. About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran a thin roll of Chinese paper. Dr. Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife, freed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters. His keen old eyes ran down the columns. His face, always cloudy now, grew darker with perplexity. \"A message,\" he declared slowly. \"I think a serious message.\" He sat down on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee. \"But the characters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail.\" He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and meaningless symbols. \"All alike,\" complained the younger man. \"Maddening.\" Then his face lighted. \"No, see here--lower left hand.\" The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose \"O. W.\" \"From Wutzler. Must mean something.\" For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle. \"Something, yes. But what?\" The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking at top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb. \"They are all alike, and yet\"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and tugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus. \"Ah!\" he said doubtfully; and at last, \"Yes.\" For some time he read to himself, nodding. \"A Triad cipher.\" \"Well?\" resumed Heywood, patiently. The reader pointed with his cigar. \"Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?\" \"'Lightning,'\" read Heywood. \"The right half?\" \"'Boat.'\" \"Take,\" the padre ordered, \"this one; left half?\" \"'Lightning,'\" repeated his pupil. \"The right half--might be 'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense.\" \"No,\" said the padre. \"You have the secret. It's good Triad writing. Subtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made the crooked straight. The writer was afraid of being caught. Here's the sense of his message, I take it.\" And he read off, slowly:-- \"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted at her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come quickly, day or night.--O.W.\" Heywood took the news coldly. He shook his head, and stood thinking. \"That won't help,\" he said curtly. \"Never in the world.\" With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured out on the highest slab of the landing-steps. Across the river, to be sure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the north--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny basket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a green rag. Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless, yet seeming to watch. Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to where, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the marsh. On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up like a thin black toadstool. He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry, summoning help from further inland. Other hats presently came bobbing toward him, low down among the marsh. Puffs of white spurted out from the mud. And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle answered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the muskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the river-stairs. \"Covered, you see,\" said Heywood, replacing the bar. \"Last resort, perhaps, that way. Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood ready here.\" The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a signal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the noise of last night broke out afresh.

Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood ready here.\" The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a signal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the noise of last night broke out afresh. The sun lowered through a brown, burnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with sudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the torrid earth and the insensate turmoil. So, without change but from pause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in the siege. Nothing happened. One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt arrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust. The paper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and heel-prints: \"Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely.\" And still nothing happened to explain the warning. That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate with four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close under the wall, and would soon become intolerable. He had returned safely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt, and a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the defenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under what in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was Kempner's grave. He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and made him stoop. \"I was coming,\" he said, \"to find you. The first night, I saw coolies working in the clay-pit. Bend, a moment over. Put now the ear close.\" Heywood laid his cheek in the dust. \"They're keeping such a racket outside,\" he muttered; and then, half to himself: \"It certainly is. Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner were--waking up.\" He listened again. \"You're right. They are digging.\" The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight. CHAPTER XIX BROTHER MOLES This new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph into a state of sullen resignation. What was the use now, he thought indignantly, of all their watching and fighting? The ground, at any moment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot. He waited for his friend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words. Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary. \"Now we know!\" said Heywood, in lively satisfaction. \"Now we know what the beasts have up their sleeve. That's a comfort. Rather!\" He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a Buddha. \"That's why they've all been lying doggo,\" he continued. \"And then their bad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see, whether they pot us or not. They'd rather make one clean sweep, and 'blow us at the moon.' Eh? Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging, they're not blowing. Are they?\" While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last giving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices. In this diluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark hospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials. Heywood listened. \"If it weren't for that,\" he said quietly, \"I shouldn't much care. Except for the women, this would really be great larks.\" Then, as a shadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: \"Ah Pat! Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!\" \"Can do.\" The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other shadows. They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust. \"Those noises have stopped, down there,\" he said to Rudolph; and rising, gave his orders briefly. The coolies were to dig, strike into the sappers' tunnel, and report at once: \"Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's take a holiday. We can smoke in the courtyard.\" A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast faint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with water from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness. Heywood stooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely into a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content. \"Luxury!\" he yawned. \"Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the compradore reports. Wonderful--too good to be true.\" For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep. Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken shadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the stars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling. The flutter of his leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne, broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers. \"Queer,\" mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch. \"The beggar puts one shot every five minutes through the", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-433a9385de00773d19f337dec628ece3", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "swooped and set the humbler flame reeling. The flutter of his leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne, broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers. \"Queer,\" mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch. \"The beggar puts one shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's thinking about? Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts. Odd! Wonder what they're all\"--He put back his cigar, mumbling. \"Handful of poor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round. And all the rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same old way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams they had in Marco Polo's day.\" The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he might have been asleep. Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking. This brief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there and wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge. Some quiet influence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him. It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more. He had felt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in clearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any later harm. With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were brightly interwoven. For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait, a single comrade in a happy army. Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving quietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place. Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady fingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass. With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent Medea, intent on some white magic. \"Aren't you coming,\" called Heywood, \"to sit with us awhile?\" \"Can't, thanks,\" she replied, without looking up. \"I'm too busy.\" \"That's no excuse. Rest a little.\" She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled back at him as from a crypt, and said:-- \"Have _you_ been hurt?\" \"Only my feelings.\" \"I've no time,\" she laughed, \"for lazy able-bodied persons.\" And she was gone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men. With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another figure, scuffing slowly toward the light. The compradore, his robes lost in their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with downward sweep. The two friends rose, and followed him down the courtyard. In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying exhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all the width. Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to which Rudolph caught the answer. \"Oh, quite composed.\" Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly. \"Yes, wonderfully composed. I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith.\" \"Dear Mrs. Earle,\" said the young man, gently, \"there ought to be no need. Nobody shall suffer, if we can prevent. I think we can.\" Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and halting, shook with quiet merriment. \"Poor dear lady!\" he whispered, and went forward chuckling. Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised mound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night. Kempner's grave had not been quieter. The compradore stood whispering: they had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were gone out to eat their chow. \"We'll see, anyway,\" said Heywood, stripping off his coat. He climbed over the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared. In the long moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him. Once, as Rudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint momentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and shoulders burrowed up again. \"Big enough hole down there,\" he reported, swinging clear, and sitting with his feet in the shaft. \"Regular cave. Three sacks of powder stowed already, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky. I struck a match, and nearly blew myself to Casabianca.\" He paused, as if reflecting. \"It gives us a plan, though. Rudie: are you game for something rather foolhardy? Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give old Gilly Forrester his chance.\" \"No!\" said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy. \"You make me--ashamed! This is all ours, this part, so!\" \"Can do,\" laughed the other. \"Get off your jacket. Give me half a moment start, so that you won't jump on my head.\" And he went wriggling down into the pit. An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness, enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping, crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.

Give me half a moment start, so that you won't jump on my head.\" And he went wriggling down into the pit. An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness, enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping, crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel. Large enough, perhaps, for two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut, through earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth floor by many hands and bare knees. It widened suddenly before him. In the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he bumped Heywood's elbow. \"Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say.\" The speaker patted the ground with quick palms, groping. \"Phew! They've worked like steam. This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow. I say, Rudie, feel about. I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it was. Ah, never mind: have-got!\" He pulled something along the floor. \"How's the old forearm I gave you? I forgot that. Equal to hauling a sack out? Good! Catch hold, here.\" Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it to where a powder-bag lay. \"Now, then, carry on,\" he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel, flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load. \"Carry these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the passage. Far out as possible, though. We can use this hole afterward, for listening in, if they try--\" He cut the sentence short. Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently downward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of burden-bearers. Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head entangled between his leader's boots. \"Quiet,\" he heard him whisper. \"Somebody coming.\" An instant later, the boots withdrew quickly. An odd little squeak of surprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks, as though some one were pummeling the earthen walls. \"Got the beggar,\" panted Heywood. \"Only one of 'em. Roll clear, Rudie, and let us pass. Collar his legs, if you can, and shove.\" Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk, like some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing. Bare feet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred squarely under his chin. He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged them dearly. \"Not too hard,\" called Heywood, with a breathless laugh. \"Poor devil--must think he ran foul of a genie.\" Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under them with limbs dissolved and quaking. \"Pass him along,\" chuckled his captor. \"Make him go ahead of us.\" Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them toward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity. In this order they gained the shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air. Rudolph, standing as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid answers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge back into the tunnel. Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the leader talked without lowering his voice. \"That chap,\" he declared, \"was fairly chattering with fright. Coolie, it seems, who came back to find his betel-box. The rest are all outside eating their rice. We have a clear track.\" They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at first easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously up a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came hard in the stifled burrow. \"Far enough,\" said Heywood, puffing. \"Pile yours here.\" Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new spirit, a spirit of daring. He would try, down here in the bowels of the earth, to emulate his friend. \"But let us reconnoitre,\" he objected. \"It will bring us to the clay-pit where I saw them digging. Let us go out to the end, and look.\" \"Well said, old mole!\" Heywood snapped his fingers with delight. \"I never thought of that.\" By his tone, he was proud of the amendment. \"Come on, by all means. I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old Gilly down here, you know.\" They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait little gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay. Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering square of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet cloth. This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader, until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.

This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader, until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers. Between shadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and distant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond which dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of boiled rice like a snowball. Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little fires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper. \"Rudie, look!\" Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement. \"Look, these bags; not sand-bags at all! It's powder, old chap, powder! Their whole supply. Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!\" He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and swiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay threshold. \"Do you know enough to time a fuse?\" he whispered. \"Neither do I. Powder's bad, anyhow. We must guess at it. Here, quick, lend me a knife.\" He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the door, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an instant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight. \"How long, Rudie, how long?\" He smothered a groan. \"Too long, or too short, spoils everything. Oh, well--here goes.\" The blade moved. \"Now lie across,\" he ordered, \"and shield the tandstickor.\" With a sudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and dancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the twisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine. Darkness followed, quick and blinding. A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out short capillary lines and needles of fire. \"Cut sticks--go like the devil! If it blows up, and caves the earth on us--\" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of going. Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension, now clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them. If it should fall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found the tunnel endless. When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were hoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening stillness lay above and about them, undisturbed. The fuse could never have lasted all these minutes. Their whole enterprise was but labor lost. They listened, breathing short. No sound came. \"Gone out,\" said Heywood, gloomily. \"Or else they saw it.\" He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall. Rudolph perched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity, for they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars. \"Gone out. Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.\" Heywood turned to leap down. \"The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine to-morrow morning.\" He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt underfoot. Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single burst of flame. The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on the ribs. \"Let him look! Let him look!\" Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a pelting shower of clods, exulted:-- \"He looked again, and saw it was The middle of next week!\" \"Come on, brother mole. Spread the news!\" He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment. CHAPTER XX THE HAKKA BOAT \"Pretty fair,\" Captain Kneebone said. \"But that ain't the end.\" This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was his only comment. On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling him with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of jealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the unreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge. It helped him to learn the cold, salutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory. The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance. It had two plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without, had changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it; and when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on all sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation. The fusillade now came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of boats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down. On the night following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded with the blows of battering-rams. These and later assaults were beaten off. By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven head was trimmed", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d909fd9c6be9d88c390751dd33c4cecf", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "fire never slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down. On the night following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded with the blows of battering-rams. These and later assaults were beaten off. By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven head was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert Forrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are playful--two shots through his loose jacket. He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and sweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes and sleepy voices. One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay tumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with obstinate flies like the driven heads of nails. As thickly, in the dust, empty Mauser cartridges lay glistening. \"And I bought food,\" mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on his cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass. \"I bought chow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!\" The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble than the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and splitting the heat. Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air, speaking few words, and those more and more surly. Once he laughed, when at broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on the knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering quizzically. Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were filled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but for himself, the situation, all things. \"Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire. What a childish trick! Maskee!\" he added, wearily \"we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they were real.\" His grimy hearers nodded mechanically. They knew, without being told, that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some final rush. \"Only a few more rounds apiece,\" he continued. \"Our friends outside must have run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in the tunnel. But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two. What's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day, from up country. He told me that a moment ago.\" \"Perhaps he's lying,\" said Captain Kneebone, drowsily. \"Wish he were,\" snapped Heywood. \"No such luck. Too stupid.\" \"That case,\" grumbled the captain, \"we'd better signal your Hakka boat, and clear out.\" Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement. It was plain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety. Thus, in stupor or doubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees, like a great fire dying. Another breathless evening settled over all--at first with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land were seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and when this had given place to night, another mysterious lull. Midnight drew on, and no further change had come. Prowlers, made bold by the long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of the compound. In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat with a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge, placidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges. Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert Forrester, who would not quit his post for either of them. \"But I'm not sleepy,\" he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity. \"I'm not, I assure you. And that river full of their boats?--Go away.\" While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the wall. They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as if a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top. Suddenly, beside it, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a long bamboo. The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only another long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags. The two poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant the ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human features. Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an uncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.

He would neither pause nor answer. The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile boats should leave the river. \"If,\" said Gilly to Rudolph, while they stood thinking under the stars, \"if his boat is still there, now that he--after what we saw.\" At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat. Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed out--that her sailors would keep their agreement. And when he had piled, on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty rose. One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man. He lay dying, and the padre could not leave him. All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because death, never punctual, now kept them waiting. The flutter of birds, among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and blurred through the dancing heat. A torrid westerly breeze came fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse. \"A fair wind lost,\" he muttered. \"Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be 'anged.\" Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet. \"We may go now,\" he said gravely, \"in a few minutes.\" No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered. Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and lighted the fire on the steps. But not one of the burial party turned his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as the padre's resonant bass continued. When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove. The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to see through the smoke that poured into his face. \"The wasters!\" he cried bitterly. \"She's gone.\" The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings. On the bronze current, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the smoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that toiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and shoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and gave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull. \"She's gone,\" repeated Captain Kneebone. \"No boat for us.\" But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an inquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through the smoke, with comical thoroughness. He dodged back, grinning and ducking amiably. \"Moh bettah look-see,\" he chuckled; \"dat coolie come-back, he too muchee waitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man.\" He was wrong. Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working upstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with the ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath the river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her. The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright golden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as some enchanted boat in a calm. The fugitives by the gate still thought themselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them, and her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped her as easily as a gondola. The yellow steersman grinned, straining at the pivot of his gigantic paddle. \"Good boy, lowdah!\" called Kneebone. \"Remember _you_ in my will, too!\" And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood. They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the loose boards of her deck. Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the bonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over her gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the white men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of all, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast eyes. He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm, and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling, nervous and wide awake. He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye.

He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm, and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling, nervous and wide awake. He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye. The rest of the company crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down wearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of rude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads. But Heywood, with his dog and the captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the ramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the sweating hold. The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout bamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like straining acrobats. As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs. Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted still before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction. Now, thinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them naked to their enemies on the knoll. At the same instant, from the marsh ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an instantaneous mushroom. He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland. They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn. Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing. \"Look there!\" he snarled. \"Those--oh!\" He ended with a groan. The face of his friend, by torchlight above the wall, had struck him dumb. Now that he spoke, his companions saw, exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a framework as on a bier. Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass. Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen. \"He did it!\" Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of control. \"Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom-- Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!\" He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's halberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow water. He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver, staring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand. Then shaking it savagely,-- \"This will do!\" he cried. \"Good-by, everybody. Good-by!\" He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly along the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark. Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to their will, stood fixed in wonder. Four or five, as the runner neared, sprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins. The watchers in the boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the frightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that Homeric blow. The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the crest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after. The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the boat drifted round the point into midstream. CHAPTER XXI THE DRAGON'S SHADOW The lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair wind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself deposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle. Captain Kneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble of his beard, had taken charge. In momentary danger of being cut off downstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the oozy shore. Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the river, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as though he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and transforming sight. Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the bank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague iron-gray, did he give over his watch. He left the tiller, with a hopeless fling of the arm. \"Do as ye please,\" he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the thatched house. \"Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and all--By the head, he was--Go on. That's all. Finish.\" He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved; nor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly hoisted above him. The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:-- \"Ay-ly-chy-ly Ah-ha-aah!\" To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long, monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.

The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:-- \"Ay-ly-chy-ly Ah-ha-aah!\" To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long, monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts. Through the rhythm, presently, broke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by distance, from far inland. The stillness of evening followed. The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone. To Rudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his first on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had first heard of his friend. Now, at the same place, and by the same light, they had heard the last. It was intolerable: he turned his back on the captain. Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's wife began suddenly to cry. After a time, the deep voice of her husband, speaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:-- \"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'\" The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway. \"All very fine,\" he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms. \"But that's no good to me. I can't stand it.\" Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from within, and found a place between him and the gunwale. He did not rouse; she neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of smooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting. When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry start. \"And I thought,\" he blurted, \"be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you liked him!\" Her dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness. \"No,\" she whispered; \"it was more than that.\" The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation. For a long time he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp, domineering voice was lowered, almost gentle. \"Always talked too much,\" he said. \"Don't mind me, my dear. I never meant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one thing more between him and the grave. Not a thing--but money. And that, now--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!\" They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined closer by new grief. Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about the deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow hold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two silent companions. Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as though studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band as black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river. Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale and thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk. A chatter of angry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind. He watched and listened, then quickly drew in his head. \"Sit quiet,\" he said. \"A boat full of men. I do not like their looks.\" Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously. The steersman, leaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer. They hailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage. Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent reply, about a cargo of human hair. His indifference appeared so real, that for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought over, and this meeting arranged. The thought, however, was unjust. The voices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with the breeze. But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up beside the lowdah, and furiously barking. Hers was no pariah's yelp: she barked with spirit, in the King's English. For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped through the matting sail. The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his paddle. Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph and the captain. Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed heavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker hats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity like golden shields of vikings. A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed the yulow hard to bring her about. \"Save your fire,\" called Captain Kneebone. \"No shots to waste. Sit tight.\" As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at the sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue. She tore the fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose pointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board. \"The Pretty Lily!\" cried Rudolph. This small, nimble, capable creature could be no one but Mrs. Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning, long ago....

This small, nimble, capable creature could be no one but Mrs. Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning, long ago.... The squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the handle. He failed, at once and for all. With great violence, yet with a neat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller, long enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash. Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill, cackling laughter. Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the Pretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman. She held her course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when she turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no more than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her teeth. Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still floundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished. Down the wind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard that craft of hers. \"We owe this to you.\" The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest, and laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder. \"Did you catch what she said? You made a good friend there.\" \"No,\" answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly. \"We owe that to--some one else.\" Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told the story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at the turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend they should see no more. They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay silent, exhausted in body and spirit. The river melted with the shore into a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen evening. Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a war-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp against a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid of eye, round the supper fire. A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated after. Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or two creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen passers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land rolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of the marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and sea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead. Ahead, far off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than their gunwale, above the rim of the world. The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the shallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary, green-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions of witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the darkness on deck. Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out the white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint semicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still sitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side. Landward, against the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the hills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back of leviathan basking. Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its guarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with uncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore loss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some unheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling. This boatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was like the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark, serene monster. Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head. From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss. Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to reach the sleepers. \"What are you thinking of?\" she said. \"Come tell me. It will be good for both of us.\" Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her. \"I thought only,\" he answered, \"how much the hills looked so--as a dragon.\" \"How strange.\" The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and still. \"I was thinking of that, in a way.

Their friendship seemed, for the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills. Years afterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder that spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of heat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the eastern sea-line. \"You are right,\" she declared once. \"To go on with life, even when we are alone--You will go on, I know. Bravely.\" And again she said: \"Yes, such men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior.\" And later, in her slow and level voice: \"You learned something, you say. Isn't that--what I call--being invulnerable? When a man's greater than anything that happens to him--\" So they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer silences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the place, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night, scope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East. The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running behind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky with summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black fibre from pulp. The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose, and moved cautiously aft. \"Good-night,\" he whispered. \"You must sleep now.\" That was not, however, the reason. So long as the boiling witch-fire turned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever the heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the lookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire gauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt out astern, and vanished. He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously. Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a measureless cavern; and still he could not tell. But at last the lowdah also turned his head, and murmured. Their boat creaked monotonously, drifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking disturbed the night, in a different cadence. Another boat followed them, rowing fast and gaining. In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered, unmistakable. Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently. He would not call out. Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same course along the coast. Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps, which presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire. The stranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold. And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more. Before he could catch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past the steersman. This time, however, as though cowed, she began to whimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine. Beside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up. \"Allo same she mastah come.\" And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled something about ghosts. A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so rapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew whether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and ecstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over the side. \"By Jove, my dream!\" sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely. With fingers that dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier. She flew up at him, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard. \"Old girl,--my dream!\" The figure rose. \"Hallo, Rudie.\" In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands, and heard the same quiet voice: \"Rest all asleep, I suppose? Don't wake 'em. To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you? Toss that fisherman--whatever you think I'm worth. He really rowed like steam, you know.\" Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat. When he turned, this man restored from the sea had disappeared. But he had only stolen forward, dog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake. So quietly had all happened, that none of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware. Rudolph drew near the two murmuring voices. \"--Couldn't help it, honestly,\" said Heywood. \"Can't describe, or explain. Just something--went black inside my head, you know.\" He paused. \"No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away the--what happened to be in my hands. A blank, all that. Losing your head, I suppose they call it. Most extraordinary.\" The girl's question recalled him from his puzzle. \"Do? Oh!\" He disposed of the subject easily. \"I ran, that's all.--Oh, yes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose. Most of 'em were away, burning your hospital. Saw the smoke, as I ran. All gone but a handful. Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three of the lot could run. I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept on scuttling. No: they weren't half loaded. Oh, yes, arrow in the shoulder--scratch. Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and made for the nearest fisherman. That's all.\" \"But,\" protested Rudolph, wondering, \"we heard shots.\" \"Yes, I had", "full_doc_id": "doc-97fd384b898ec2ed81bb585718690af5", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e1876f424b05897dac23b01553cb7070", "__created_at__": 1758352096, "content": "gone but a handful.

You _were_ the only one to know.\" \"No,\" said the girl: \"I knew--all the time, that--\" Whatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he thought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting were not possible, here or somewhere. Recalling this, he suddenly but quietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in the darkness. The two voices flowed on. He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus welling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the tropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters. The shape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy. How ran the verse? \"Ich lieg' und besitze. Lass mich schlafen.\" \"And yet,\" thought the young man, \"I have one pearl from his hoard.\" That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the raw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable. Heywood was calling to him:-- \"You must go Home with us. Do you hear? I've made a wonderful plan--with the captain's fortune! Dear old Kneebone.\" A small white heap across the deck began to rise. \"How often,\" complained a voice blurred with sleep, \"how often must I tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!\" At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with sleepy cries of joy.
