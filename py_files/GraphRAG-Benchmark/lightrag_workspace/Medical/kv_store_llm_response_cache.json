You can do the same on your computer. Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. Add it to your phone. Hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. Keep your primary care physician informed of changes to this list. Create a medical binder A medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. Make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. It will be helpful when getting a second opinion. Choose a binder that meets your needs. Consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. Create folders for insurance forms, medical records, and tests results. You can do the same on your computer. Use online patient portals to view your test results and other records. Download or print the records to add to your binder. Organize your binder in a way that works for you. Add a section for questions and to take notes. Bring your medical binder to appointments. You never know when you might need it! General health tests Medical history A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Tell your doctor about any symptoms you have. A medical or health history will help determine which treatment is best for you. Family history Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. Physical exam During a physical exam, a health care provider may: Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate Check your weight and height Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain. Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your doctor if you have felt any lumps or have any pain. NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Adrenal Tumors, 2022 What is your family health history? Some cancers and other diseases run in families—those who are related to you through genes passed down from parent to child. This information is called a family health history. You can ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. For relatives who have died, ask about the cause and age of death. Start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, niece and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. Write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. Some of the questions to ask include: Do you have any chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, or health conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Have you had any other diseases, such as cancer or stroke? How old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? What is our family’s ancestry—from what countries did our ancestors originate? Imaging tests Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. A radiologist, an expert in interpreting test images, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. Your test results will be discussed with you. CT scan A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture. In most cases, contrast will be used. Contrast Contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. Contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. It might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). The contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine after the test. The types of contrast vary but are different for CT than for MRI. Tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and prednisone (steroids), to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys are not working well. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays. Contrast might be used. An MRI may be used as an initial test, to check treatment results, and to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to help see cancer cells in the body. PET scans are performed about an hour after the tracer is injected. PET scans are combined with CT or MRI scans (PET/CT or PET/MRI) to determine where the cancer cells are located. This combined test is considered to be more accurate than either scan alone. Types of PET scans that can be helpful for those with adrenal tumors include FDG-PET and SSTRPET. FDG-PET/CT scan An FDG-PET scan uses a radioactive type of sugar (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) as its tracer. Active cancer cells use sugar faster than normal cells. This will make the cells\n```\n\n---Output---",

How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface. Melanocytes – Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin. Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin, and eye color. It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. This book is only about basal cell skin cancer. For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Signs and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it’s most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes. In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don’t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence.
