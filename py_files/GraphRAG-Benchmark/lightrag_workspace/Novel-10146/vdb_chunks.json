The result as here presented is therefore a joint product. Mr Wallace, himself a writer of ability and a student of Canadian history, naturally made a very free translation of my work and introduced some ideas of his own. He insists, however, that the work is mine; and, with this acknowledgment of his part in it, I can do no less than acquiesce, at the same time expressing my pleasure at having had as collaborator a young writer of such good insight. And it is surely appropriate that an English Canadian and a French Canadian should join in a narrative of the political war between the two races which forms the subject of this book. A. D. DECELLES.

It placed the French inhabitants under the sway of an alien race--a race of another language, of another religion, of other laws, and which differed from them profoundly in temperament and political outlook. Elsewhere--in Ireland, in Poland, and in the Balkans--such conquests have been followed by centuries of bitter racial warfare. In Canada, however, for a hundred and fifty years French Canadians and English Canadians have, on the whole, dwelt together in peace and amity. Only on the one occasion, of which the story is to be told in these pages, has there been anything resembling civil war between the two races; and this unhappy outbreak was neither widespread nor prolonged. The record {2} is one which Canadians, whether they be English or French, have reason to view with satisfaction. It does not appear that the Canadians of 1760 felt any profound regret at the change from French to British rule. So corrupt and oppressive had been the administration of Bigot, in the last days of the Old Regime, that the rough-and-ready rule of the British army officers doubtless seemed benignant in comparison. Comparatively few Canadians left the country, although they were afforded facilities for so doing. One evidence of good feeling between the victors and the vanquished is found in the marriages which were celebrated between Canadian women and some of the disbanded Highland soldiers. Traces of these unions are found at the present day, in the province of Quebec, in a few Scottish names of habitants who cannot speak English.

Comparatively few Canadians left the country, although they were afforded facilities for so doing. One evidence of good feeling between the victors and the vanquished is found in the marriages which were celebrated between Canadian women and some of the disbanded Highland soldiers. Traces of these unions are found at the present day, in the province of Quebec, in a few Scottish names of habitants who cannot speak English. When the American colonies broke out in revolution in 1775, the Continental Congress thought to induce the French Canadians to join hands with them. But the conciliatory policy of the successive governors Murray and Carleton, and the concessions granted by the Quebec Act of the year before, had borne {3} fruit; and when the American leaders Arnold and Montgomery invaded Canada, the great majority of the habitants remained at least passively loyal. A few hundred of them may have joined the invaders, but a much larger number enlisted under Carleton. The clergy, the seigneurs, and the professional classes--lawyers and physicians and notaries--remained firm in their allegiance to Great Britain; while the mass of the people resisted the eloquent appeals of Congress, represented by its emissaries Franklin, Chase, and Carroll, and even those of the distinguished Frenchmen, Lafayette and Count d'Estaing, who strongly urged them to join the rebels. Nor should it be forgotten that at the siege of Quebec by Arnold the Canadian officers Colonel Dupre and Captains Dambourges, Dumas, and Marcoux, with many others, were among Carleton's most trusted and efficient aides in driving back the invading Americans. True, in 1781, Sir Frederick Haldimand, then governor of Canada, wrote that although the clergy had been firmly loyal in 1775 and had exerted their powerful influence in favour of Great Britain, they had since then changed their opinions and were no longer to be relied upon. But it must be {4} borne in mind that Haldimand ruled the province in the manner of a soldier. His high-handed orders caused dissatisfaction, which he probably mistook for a want of loyalty among the clergy. No more devoted subject of Great Britain lived at the time in Lower Canada than Mgr Briand, the bishop of Quebec; and the priests shaped their conduct after that of their superior. At any rate, the danger which Haldimand feared did not take form; and the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 made it more unlikely than ever. The French Revolution profoundly affected the attitude of the French Canadians toward France. Canada was the child of the _ancien regime_. Within her borders the ideas of Voltaire and Rousseau had found no shelter. Canada had nothing in common with the anti-clerical and republican tendencies of the Revolution. That movement created a gap between France and Canada which has not been bridged to this day. In the Napoleonic wars the sympathies of Canada were almost wholly with Great Britain. When news arrived of the defeat of the French fleet at Trafalgar, a _Te Deum_ was sung in the Catholic cathedral at Quebec; and, in a sermon {5} preached on that occasion, a future bishop of the French-Canadian Church enunciated the principle that 'all events which tend to broaden the gap separating us from France should be welcome.' It was during the War of 1812-14, however, that the most striking manifestation of French-Canadian loyalty to the British crown appeared. In that war, in which Canada was repeatedly invaded by American armies, French-Canadian militiamen under French-Canadian officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their English-speaking fellow-countrymen on several stricken fields of battle; and in one engagement, fought at Chateauguay in the French province of Lower Canada, the day was won for British arms by the heroic prowess of Major de Salaberry and his French-Canadian soldiers. The history of the war with the United States provides indelible testimony to the loyalty of French Canada. A quarter of a century passed. Once again the crack of muskets was heard on Canadian soil. This time, however, there was no foreign invader to repel. The two races which had fought side by side in 1812 were now arrayed against each other. French-Canadian veterans of Chateauguay were on {6} one side, and English-Canadian veterans of Chrystler's Farm on the other. Some real fighting took place. Before peace was restored, the fowling-pieces of the French-Canadian rebels had repulsed a force of British regulars at the village of St Denis, and brisk skirmishes had taken place at the villages of St Charles and St Eustache. How this unhappy interlude came to pass, in a century and a half of British rule in Canada, it is the object of this book to explain. {7} CHAPTER II THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFEATED The British did not treat the French inhabitants of Canada as a conquered people; not as other countries won by conquest have been treated by their victorious invaders. The terms of the Capitulation of Montreal in 1760 assured the Canadians of their property and civil rights, and guaranteed to them 'the free exercise of their religion.' The Quebec Act of 1774 granted them the whole of the French civil law, to the almost complete exclusion of the English common law, and virtually established in Canada the Church of the vanquished through legal enforcement of the obligation resting upon Catholics to pay tithes. And when it became necessary in 1791 to divide Canada into two provinces, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, one predominantly English and the other predominantly French, the two provinces were granted precisely equal political rights. Out of this {8} arose an odd situation.

And when it became necessary in 1791 to divide Canada into two provinces, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, one predominantly English and the other predominantly French, the two provinces were granted precisely equal political rights. Out of this {8} arose an odd situation. All French Canadians were Roman Catholics, and Roman Catholics were at this time debarred from sitting in the House of Commons at Westminster. Yet they were given the right of sitting as members in the Canadian representative Assemblies created by the Act of 1791. The Catholics of Canada thus received privileges denied to their co-religionists in Great Britain. There can be no doubt that it was the conciliatory policy of the British government which kept the clergy, the seigneurs, and the great body of French Canadians loyal to the British crown during the war in 1775 and in 1812. It is certain, too, that these generous measures strengthened the position of the French race in Canada, made Canadians more jealous of their national identity, and led them to press for still wider liberties. It is an axiom of human nature that the more one gets, the more one wants. And so the concessions granted merely whetted the Canadian appetite for more. This disposition became immediately apparent with the calling of the first parliament of Lower Canada in 1792. Before this there had been no specific definition of the exact status of the French language in {9} Canada, and the question arose as to its use in the Assembly as a medium of debate. As the Quebec Act of 1774 had restored the French laws, it was inferred that the use of the French language had been authorized, since otherwise these laws would have no natural medium of interpretation. That this was the inference to be drawn from the constitution became evident, for the British government had made no objection to the use of French in the law-courts. It should be borne in mind that at this period the English in Canada were few in number, and that all of them lived in the cities. The French members in the Assembly, representing, as they did, nearly the whole population, did not hesitate to press for the official recognition of their language on a parity with English. The question first came up in connection with the election of a speaker. The French-Canadian members, being in a majority of thirty-four to sixteen, proposed Jean Antoine Panet. This motion was opposed by the English members, together with a few of the French members, who nominated an Englishman. They pointed out that the transactions between the speaker and the king's {10} representative in the colony should be 'in the language of the empire to which we have the happiness to belong.' 'I think it is but decent,' said Louis Panet, brother of Jean Antoine, 'that the speaker on whom we fix our choice, be one who can express himself in English when he addresses himself to the representative of our sovereign.' Yet the majority of the French members stuck to their motion and elected their speaker. When he was sworn into office, he declared to the governor that 'he could only express himself in the primitive language of his native country.' Nevertheless, he understood English well enough to conduct the business of the House. And it should not be forgotten that all the sixteen English members, out of the fifty composing the Assembly, owed their election to French-Canadian voters. Almost immediately the question came up again in the debate on the use of the French language in the publication of official documents. The English members pointed out that English was the language of the sovereign, and they contended that the exclusive official use of the English language would more quickly assimilate the French Canadians--would render them more loyal. To these {11} arguments the French Canadians replied with ringing eloquence. 'Remember,' said Chartier de Lotbiniere, 'the year 1775. Those Canadians, who spoke nothing but French, showed their attachment to their sovereign in a manner not at all equivocal. They helped to defend this province. This city, these walls, this chamber in which I have the honour to speak, were saved partly through their zeal and their courage. You saw them join with faithful subjects of His Majesty and repulse attacks which people who spoke very good English made on this city. It is not, you see, uniformity of language which makes peoples more faithful or more united.' 'Is it not ridiculous,' exclaimed Pierre Bedard, whose name will appear later in these pages, 'to wish to make a people's loyalty consist in its tongue?' The outcome of the debate, as might have been expected, was to place the French language on a level with the English language in the records and publications of the Assembly, and French became, to all intents and purposes, the language of debate. The number of English-speaking members steadily decreased. In the year 1800 Sir Robert Milnes {12} wrote home that there were 'but one or two English members in the House of Assembly who venture to speak in the language of the mother country, from the certainty of not being understood by a great majority of the House.' It must not be imagined, however, that in these early debates there was any of that rancour and animosity which later characterized the proceedings of the Assembly of Lower Canada.

Even as late as 1807, it appears that 'party spirit had not yet extended its effects to destroy social intercourse and good neighbourhood.' It was not until the regime of Sir James Craig that racial bitterness really began. {13} CHAPTER III 'THE REIGN OF TERROR' During the session of 1805 the Assembly was confronted with the apparently innocent problem of building prisons. Yet out of the debate on this subject sprang the most serious racial conflict which had yet occurred in the province. There were two ways proposed for raising the necessary money. One, advocated by the English members, was to levy a direct tax on land; the other, proposed by the French members, was to impose extra customs duties. The English proposal was opposed by the French, for the simple reason that the interests of the French were in the main agrarian; and the French proposal was opposed by the English, because the interests of the English were on the whole commercial. The English pointed out that, as merchants, they had borne the brunt of such taxation as had already been imposed, and that it was the turn of the French farmers to bear their {14} share. The French, on the other hand, pointed out, with some justice, that indirect taxation was borne, not only by the importer, but also partly by the consumer, and that indirect taxation was therefore more equitable than a tax on the land-owners alone. There was, moreover, another consideration. 'The _Habitants_,' writes the political annalist already quoted, 'consider themselves sufficiently taxed by the French law of the land, in being obliged to pay rents and other feudal burthens to the Seigneur, and tythes to the Priest; and if you were to ask any of them to contribute two bushels of Wheat, or two Dollars, for the support of Government, he would give you the equivocal French sign of inability or unwillingness, by shrugging up his shoulders.' As usual, the French-Canadian majority carried their point. Thereupon, the indignation of the English minority flared forth in a very emphatic manner. They accused the French Canadians of foisting upon them the whole burden of taxation, and they declared that an end must be put to French-Canadian domination over English Canadians. 'This province,' asserted the Quebec _Mercury_, 'is already too French for a British colony.... Whether we be in peace or at war, it is essential {15} that we should make every effort, by every means available, to oppose the growth of the French and their influence.' The answer of the French Canadians to this language was the establishment in 1806 of a newspaper, _Le Canadien_, in which the point of view of the majority in the House might be presented. The official editor of the paper was Jean Antoine Bouthillier, but the conspicuous figure on the staff was Pierre Bedard, one of the members of the House of Assembly. The tone of the paper was generally moderate, though militant. Its policy was essentially to defend the French against the ceaseless aspersions of the _Mercury_ and other enemies. It never attacked the British government, but only the provincial authorities. Its motto, '_Notre langue, nos institutions et nos lois_,' went far to explain its views and objects. No serious trouble resulted, however, from the policy of _Le Canadien_ until after the arrival of Sir James Craig in Canada, and the inauguration of what some historians have named 'the Reign of Terror.' Sir James Craig, who became governor of Canada in 1807, was a distinguished soldier. He had seen service in the American Revolutionary {16} War, in South Africa, and in India. He was, however, inexperienced in civil government and apt to carry his ideas of military discipline into the conduct of civil affairs. Moreover, he was prejudiced against the inhabitants and had doubts of their loyalty. In Canada he surrounded himself with such men as Herman W. Ryland, the governor's secretary, and John Sewell, the attorney-general, men who were actually in favour of repressing the French Canadians and of crushing the power of their Church. 'I have long since laid it down as a principle (which in my judgment no Governor of this Province ought to lose sight of for a moment),' wrote Ryland in 1804, 'by every possible means which prudence can suggest, gradually to undermine the authority and influence of the Roman Catholic Priest.' 'The Province must be converted into an English Colony,' declared Sewell, 'or it will ultimately be lost to England.' The opinion these men held of the French Canadians was most uncomplimentary. 'In the ministerial dictionary,' complained _Le Canadien_, 'a bad fellow, anti-ministerialist, democrat, _sans culotte_, and damned Canadian, mean the same thing.' [Illustration: Sir James Craig. From a portrait in the Dominion Archives.] Surrounded by such advisers, it is not {17} surprising that Sir James Craig soon took umbrage at the language and policy of _Le Canadien_. At first he made his displeasure felt in a somewhat roundabout way. In the summer of 1808 he dismissed from the militia five officers who were reputed to have a connection with that newspaper, on the ground that they were helping a 'seditious and defamatory journal.' One of these officers was Colonel Panet, who had fought in the defence of Quebec in 1775 and had been speaker of the House of Assembly since 1792; another was Pierre Bedard.

One of these officers was Colonel Panet, who had fought in the defence of Quebec in 1775 and had been speaker of the House of Assembly since 1792; another was Pierre Bedard. This action did not, however, curb the temper of the paper; and a year or more later Craig went further. In May 1810 he took the extreme step of suppressing _Le Canadien_, and arresting the printer and three of the proprietors, Taschereau, Blanchet, and Bedard. The ostensible pretext for this measure was the publication in the paper of some notes of a somewhat academic character with regard to the conflict which had arisen between the governor and the House of Assembly in Jamaica; the real reason, of course, went deeper. Craig afterwards asserted that the arrest of Bedard and his associates was 'a measure of precaution, not of punishment.' There is no {18} doubt that he actually feared a rising of the French Canadians. To his mind a rebellion was imminent. The event showed that his suspicions were ill-founded; but in justice to him it must be remembered that he was governor of Canada at a dangerous time, when Napoleon was at the zenith of his power and when agents of this arch-enemy of England were supposed to be active in Canada. Moreover, the blame for Craig's action during this period must be partly borne by the 'Bureaucrats' who surrounded him. There is no absolute proof, but there is at least a presumption, that some of these men actually wished to precipitate a disturbance, in order that the constitution of Lower Canada might be suspended and a new order of things inaugurated. Soon after Bedard's arrest his friends applied for a writ of habeas corpus; but, owing to the opposition of Craig, this was refused. In July two of Bedard's companions were released, on the ground of ill health. They both, however, expressed regret at the tone which _Le Canadien_ had adopted. In August the printer was discharged. Bedard himself declined to accept his release until he had been brought to trial and acquitted {19} of the charge preferred against him. Craig, however, did not dare to bring him to trial, for no jury would have convicted him. Ultimately, since Bedard refused to leave the prison, he was ejected at the point of the bayonet. The situation was full of humour. Bedard was an excellent mathematician, and was in the habit of whiling away the hours of his imprisonment by solving mathematical problems. When the guard came to turn him out, he was in the midst of a geometrical problem. 'At least,' he begged, 'let me finish my problem.' The request was granted; an hour later the problem was solved, and Bedard was thrust forth from the jail. Sir James Craig was a man of good heart and of the best intentions; but his course throughout this episode was most unfortunate. Not only did he fail to suppress the opposition to his government, but he did much to embitter the relations between the two races. Craig himself seems to have realized, even before he left Canada, that his policy had been a mistake; for he is reported on good authority to have said 'that he had been basely deceived, and that if it had been given to him to begin his administration over again, he would have acted differently.' It is {20} significant, too, that Craig's successor, Sir George Prevost, completely reversed his policy. He laid himself out to conciliate the French Canadians in every way possible; and he made amends to Bedard for the injustice which he had suffered by restoring him to his rank in the militia and by making him a judge. As a result, the bitterness of racial feeling abated; and when the War of 1812 broke out, there proved to be less disloyalty in Lower Canada than in Upper Canada. But, as the events of Craig's administration had clearly shown, a good deal of combustible and dangerous material lay about. {21} CHAPTER IV THE RISE OF PAPINEAU In the year 1812 a young man took his seat in the House of Assembly for Lower Canada who was destined to play a conspicuous part in the history of the province during the next quarter of a century. His name was Louis Joseph Papineau. He was at that time only twenty-six years of age, but already his tall, well-built form, his fine features and commanding presence, marked him out as a born leader of men. He possessed an eloquence which, commonplace as it now appears on the printed page, apparently exerted a profound influence upon his contemporaries. 'Never within the memory of teacher or student,' wrote his college friend Aubert de Gaspe, 'had a voice so eloquent filled the halls of the seminary of Quebec.' In the Assembly his rise to prominence was meteoric; only three years after his entrance he was elected speaker on the resignation of the veteran {22} J. A. Panet, who had held the office at different times since 1792.

[Illustration: Louis Joseph Papineau. After a lithograph by Maurin, Paris.] When Papineau entered public life the political situation in Lower Canada was beginning to be complicated. The French-Canadian members of the Assembly, having taken great pains to acquaint themselves with the law and custom of the British constitution, had awakened to the fact that they were not enjoying the position or the power which the members of the House of Commons in England were enjoying. In the first place, the measures which they passed were being continually thrown out by the upper chamber, the Legislative Council, and they were powerless to prevent it; and in the second place, they had no control of the government, for the governor and his Executive Council were appointed by and responsible to the Colonial Office alone. The members of the two councils were in the main of English birth, and they constituted a local oligarchy--known as the 'Bureaucrats' or the 'Chateau Clique'--which {23} held the reins of government. They were as a rule able to snap their fingers at the majority in the Assembly. In England the remedy for a similar state of affairs had been found to lie in the control of the purse exercised by the House of Commons. In order to bring the Executive to its will, it was only necessary for that House to threaten the withholding of supplies. In Lower Canada, however, such a remedy was at first impossible, for the simple reason that the House of Assembly did not vote all the supplies necessary for carrying on the government. In other words, the expenditure far exceeded the revenue; and the deficiency had to be met out of the Imperial exchequer. Under these circumstances it was impossible for the Lower Canada Assembly to attempt to exercise the full power of the purse. In 1810, it is true, the Assembly had passed a resolution avowing its ability and willingness to vote 'the necessary sums for defraying the Civil Expenses of the Government of the Province.' But Sir James Craig had declined on a technicality to forward the resolution to the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, realizing fully that if the offer were accepted, the Assembly would be able to exert complete {24} power over the Executive. 'The new Trojan horse' was not to gain admission to the walls through him. Later, however, in 1818, during the administration of Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, the offer of the Assembly was accepted by the Imperial government. Sherbrooke was an apostle of conciliation. It was he who gave the Catholic bishop of Quebec a seat in the Executive Council; and he also recommended that the speaker of the House of Assembly should be included in the Council--a recommendation which was a preliminary move in the direction of responsible government. Through Sherbrooke's instrumentality the British government now decided to allow the Lower-Canadian legislature to vote the entire revenue of the province, apart from the casual and territorial dues of the Crown and certain duties levied by Act of the Imperial parliament. Sherbrooke's intention was that the legislature should vote out of this revenue a permanent civil list to be continued during the lifetime of the sovereign. Unfortunately, however, the Assembly did not fall in with this view. It insisted, instead, on treating the civil list as an annual affair, and voting the salaries of the officials, from the governor {25} downwards, for only one year. Since this would have made every government officer completely dependent upon the pleasure of the House of Assembly, the Legislative Council promptly threw out the budget. Thus commenced a struggle which was destined to last for many years. The Assembly refused to see that its action was really an encroachment upon the sphere of the Executive; and the Executive refused to place itself at the mercy of the Assembly. The result was deadlock. During session after session the supplies were not voted. The Executive, with its control of the royal revenue, was able by one means or another to carry on the government; but the relations between the 'Bureaucrats' and the _Patriotes_ became rapidly more bitter. Papineau's attitude toward the government during this period was in harmony with that of his compatriots. It was indeed one of his characteristics, as the historian Christie has pointed out, that he seemed always 'to move with the masses rather than to lead them.' In 1812 he fought side by side with the British. As late as 1820 he publicly expressed his great admiration for the constitution of 1791 and the blessings of British rule. But in the struggles over the budget he took up ground {26} strongly opposed to the government; and, when the question became acute, he threw restraint to the winds, and played the part of a dangerous agitator. What seems to have first roused Papineau to anger was a proposal to unite Upper and Lower Canada in 1822. Financial difficulties had arisen between the two provinces; and advantage was taken of this fact to introduce a Union Bill into the House of Commons at Westminster, couched in terms very unfavourable to the French Canadians. There is little doubt that the real objects of the bill was the extinction of the Lower-Canadian Assembly and the subordination of the French to the English element in the colony. At any rate, the French Canadians saw in the bill a menace to their national existence. Two agents were promptly appointed to go over to London to oppose it. One of them was Papineau; the other was John Neilson, the capable Scottish editor of the Quebec _Gazette_. The two men made a very favourable impression; they enlisted on their side the leaders of the Whig party in the Commons; and they succeeded in having the bill well and duly shelved.

At any rate, the French Canadians saw in the bill a menace to their national existence. Two agents were promptly appointed to go over to London to oppose it. One of them was Papineau; the other was John Neilson, the capable Scottish editor of the Quebec _Gazette_. The two men made a very favourable impression; they enlisted on their side the leaders of the Whig party in the Commons; and they succeeded in having the bill well and duly shelved. Their mission resulted not only in the defeat of the bill; it also showed {27} them clearly that a deep-laid plot had menaced the rights and liberties of the French-Canadian people; and their anger was roused against what Neilson described as 'the handful of _intrigants_' who had planned that _coup d'etat_. On returning to Canada Papineau gave vent to his discontent in an extraordinary attack upon Lord Dalhousie, who had become governor of Canada in 1819. Dalhousie was an English nobleman of the best type. His tastes were liberal. He was instrumental in founding the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec; and he showed his desire for pleasant relations between the two races in Canada by the erection of the joint monument to Wolfe and Montcalm in the city of Quebec, in the governor's garden. His administration, however, had been marred by one or two financial irregularities. Owing to the refusal of the Assembly to vote a permanent civil list, Dalhousie had been forced to expend public moneys without authority from the legislature; and his receiver-general, Caldwell, had been guilty of defalcations to the amount of L100,000. Papineau attacked Dalhousie as if he had been personally responsible for these defalcations. The speech, we are told by the chronicler Bibaud, recalled in its violence the {28} philippics of Demosthenes and the orations against Catiline of Cicero. The upshot of this attack was that all relations between Dalhousie and Papineau were broken off. Apart altogether from the political controversy, Dalhousie felt that he could have no intercourse with a man who had publicly insulted him. Consequently, when Papineau was elected to the speakership of the Assembly in 1827, Dalhousie refused to recognize him as speaker; and when the Assembly refused to reconsider his election, Dalhousie promptly dissolved it. It would be tedious to describe in detail the political events of these years; and it is enough to say that by 1827 affairs in the province had come to such an impasse, partly owing to the financial quarrel, and partly owing to the personal war between Papineau and Dalhousie, that it was decided by the _Patriotes_ to send another deputation to England to ask for the redress of grievances and for the removal of Dalhousie. The members of the deputation were John Neilson and two French Canadians, Augustin Cuvillier and Denis B. Viger. Papineau was an interested party and did not go. The deputation proved no less successful than {29} that which had crossed the Atlantic in 1822. The delegates succeeded in obtaining Lord Dalhousie's recall, and they were enabled to place their case before a special committee of the House of Commons. The committee made a report very favourable to the _Patriote_ cause; recommended that 'the French-Canadians should not in any way be disturbed in the exercise and enjoyment of their religion, their laws, or their privileges'; and expressed the opinion that 'the true interests of the provinces would be best promoted by placing the collection and expenditure of all public revenues under the control of the House of Assembly.' The report was not actually adopted by the House of Commons, but it lent a very welcome support to the contentions of Papineau and his friends. At last, in 1830, the British government made a serious and well-meant attempt to settle, once and for all, the financial difficulty. Lord Goderich, who was at that time at the Colonial Office, instructed Lord Aylmer, who had become governor of Canada in 1830, to resign to the Assembly the control of the entire revenue of the province, with the single exception of the casual and territorial revenue of the Crown, if the Assembly would grant {30} in exchange a civil list of L19,000, voted for the lifetime of the king. This offer was a compromise which should have proved acceptable to both sides. But Papineau and his friends determined not to yield an inch of ground; and in the session of 1831 they succeeded in defeating the motion for the adoption of Lord Goderich's proposal. That this was a mistake even the historian Garneau, who cannot be accused of hostility toward the _Patriotes_, has admitted. Throughout this period Papineau's course was often unreasonable. He complained that the French Canadians had no voice in the executive government, and that all the government offices were given to the English; yet when he was offered a seat in the Executive Council in 1822 he declined it; and when Dominique Mondelet, one of the members of the Assembly, accepted a seat in the Executive Council in 1832, he was hounded from the Assembly by Papineau and his friends as a traitor.

As Sir George Cartier pointed out many years later, Mondelet's inclusion in the Executive Council was really a step in the direction of responsible government. It is difficult, also, to approve Papineau's attitude toward such governors as Dalhousie and {31} Aylmer, both of whom were disposed to be friendly. Papineau's attitude threw them into the arms of the 'Chateau Clique.' The truth is that Papineau was too unbending, too _intransigeant_, to make a good political leader. As was seen clearly in his attitude toward the financial proposals of Lord Goderich in 1830, he possessed none of that spirit of compromise which lies at the heart of English constitutional development. On the other hand, it must be remembered that Papineau and his friends received much provocation. The attitude of the governing class toward them was overbearing and sometimes insolent. They were regarded as members of an inferior race. And they would have been hardly human if they had not bitterly resented the conspiracy against their liberties embodied in the abortive Union Bill of 1822. There were real abuses to be remedied. Grave financial irregularities had been detected in the executive government; sinecurists, living in England, drew pay for services which they did not perform; gross favouritism existed in appointments to office under the Crown; and so many office-holders held seats in the Legislative Council that the Council was actually under the thumb of {32} the executive government. Yet when the Assembly strove to remedy these grievances, its efforts were repeatedly blocked by the Legislative Council; and even when appeal was made to the Colonial Office, removal of the abuses was slow in coming. Last, but not least, the Assembly felt that it did not possess an adequate control over the expenditure of the moneys for the voting of which it was primarily responsible. {33} CHAPTER V THE NINETY-TWO RESOLUTIONS After 1830 signs began to multiply that the racial feud in Lower Canada was growing in intensity. In 1832 a by-election in the west ward of Montreal culminated in a riot. Troops were called out to preserve order. After showing some forbearance under a fusillade of stones, they fired into the rioters, killing three and wounding two men, all of them French Canadians. Immediately the _Patriote_ press became furious. The newspaper _La Minerve_ asserted that a 'general massacre' had been planned: the murderers, it said, had approached the corpses with laughter, and had seen with joy Canadian blood running down the street; they had shaken each other by the hand, and had regretted that there were not more dead. The blame for the 'massacre' was laid at the door of Lord Aylmer. Later, on the floor of the Assembly, Papineau remarked that 'Craig merely imprisoned his {34} victims, but Aylmer slaughters them.' The _Patriotes_ adopted the same bitter attitude toward the government when the Asiatic cholera swept the province in 1833. They actually accused Lord Aylmer of having 'enticed the sick immigrants into the country, in order to decimate the ranks of the French Canadians.' In the House Papineau became more and more violent and domineering. He did not scruple to use his majority either to expel from the House or to imprison those who incurred his wrath. Robert Christie, the member for Gaspe, was four times expelled for having obtained the dismissal of some partisan justices of the peace. The expulsion of Dominique Mondelet has already been mentioned. Ralph Taylor, one of the members for the Eastern Townships, was imprisoned in the common jail for using, in the Quebec _Mercury_, language about Papineau no more offensive than Papineau had used about many others. But perhaps the most striking evidence of Papineau's desire to dominate the Assembly was seen in his attitude toward a bill to secure the independence of judges introduced by F. A. Quesnel, one of the more moderate members {35} of the _Patriote_ party. Quesnel had accepted some amendments suggested by the colonial secretary. This awoke the wrath of Papineau, who assailed the bill in his usual vehement style, and concluded by threatening Quesnel with the loss of his seat. The threat proved not to be idle. Papineau possessed at this time a great ascendancy over the minds of his fellow-countrymen, and in the next elections he secured Quesnel's defeat. By 1832 Papineau's political views had taken a more revolutionary turn. From being an admirer of the constitution of 1791, he had come to regard it as 'bad; very, very bad.' 'Our constitution,' he said, 'has been manufactured by a Tory influenced by the terrors of the French Revolution.' He had lost faith in the justice of the British government and in its willingness to redress grievances; and his eyes had begun to turn toward the United States. Perhaps he was not yet for annexation to that country; but he had conceived a great admiration for the American constitution. The wide application of the principle of election especially attracted him; and, although he did not relinquish his hope of subordinating the Executive to the Assembly by means of the control of the finances, he {36} began to throw his main weight into an agitation to make the Legislative Council elective. Henceforth the plan for an elective Legislative Council became the chief feature of the policy of the _Patriote_ party. The existing nominated and reactionary Legislative Council had served the purpose of a buffer between the governor's Executive Council and the Assembly.

Henceforth the plan for an elective Legislative Council became the chief feature of the policy of the _Patriote_ party. The existing nominated and reactionary Legislative Council had served the purpose of a buffer between the governor's Executive Council and the Assembly. This buffer, thought Papineau and his friends, should be removed, so as to expose the governor to the full hurricane of the Assembly's wrath. It was not long before Papineau's domineering behaviour and the revolutionary trend of his views alienated some of his followers. On John Neilson, who had gone to England with him in 1822 and with Cuvillier and Viger in 1828, and who had supported him heartily during the Dalhousie regime, Papineau could no longer count. Under Aylmer a coolness sprang up between the two men. Neilson objected to the expulsion of Mondelet from the House; he opposed the resolutions of Louis Bourdages, Papineau's chief lieutenant, for the abolition of the Legislative Council; and in the debate on Quesnel's bill for the independence of judges, he administered a severe rebuke to Papineau for language he {37} had used. Augustin Cuvillier followed the lead of his friend Neilson, and so also did Andrew Stuart, one of the ablest lawyers in the province, and Quesnel. All these men were politicians of weight and respectability. Papineau still had, however, a large and powerful following, especially among the younger members. Nothing is more remarkable at this time than the sway which he exercised over the minds of men who in later life became distinguished for the conservative and moderate character of their opinions. Among his followers in the House were Louis Hippolyte LaFontaine, destined to become, ten years later, the colleague of Robert Baldwin in the LaFontaine-Baldwin administration, and Augustin Norbert Morin, the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin administration of 1851. Outside the House he counted among his most faithful followers two more future prime ministers of Canada, George E. Cartier and Etienne P. Tache. Nor were his supporters all French Canadians. Some English-speaking members acted with him, among them Wolfred Nelson; and in the country he had the undivided allegiance of men like Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, editor of the Montreal _Vindicator_, {38} and Thomas Storrow Brown, afterwards one of the 'generals' of the rebellion. Although the political struggle in Lower Canada before 1837 was largely racial, it was not exclusively so, for there were some English in the Patriots party and some French who declined to support it. In 1832 and 1833 Papineau suffered rebuffs in the House that could not have been pleasant to him. In 1833, for instance, his proposal to refuse supply was defeated by a large majority. But the triumphant passage of the famous Ninety-Two Resolutions in 1834 showed that, for most purposes, he still had a majority behind him. The Ninety-Two Resolutions were introduced by Elzear Bedard, the son of Pierre Bedard, and are reputed to have been drawn up by A. N. Morin. But there is no doubt that they were inspired by Papineau. The voice was the voice of Jacob, but the hand was the hand of Esau. The Resolutions constituted the political platform of the extreme wing of the _Patriote_ party: they were a sort of Declaration of Right. A more extraordinary political document has seldom seen the light. A writer in the Quebec _Mercury_, said by Lord Aylmer to be John Neilson, {39} undertook an analysis of the ninety-two articles: eleven, said this writer, stood true; six contained both truth and falsehood; sixteen stood wholly false; seventeen seemed doubtful and twelve ridiculous; seven were repetitions; fourteen consisted only of abuse; four were both false and seditious; and the remainder were indifferent. It is not possible here to analyse the Resolutions in detail. They called the attention of the home government to some real abuses. The subservience of the Legislative Council to the Executive Council; the partisanship of some of the judges; the maladministration of the wild lands; grave irregularities in the receiver-general's office; the concentration of a variety of public offices in the same persons; the failure of the governor to issue a writ for the election of a representative for the county of Montreal; and the expenditure of public moneys without the consent of the Assembly--all these, and many others, were enlarged upon. If the framers of the Resolutions had only cared to make out a very strong case they might have done so. But the language which they employed to present their case was almost certainly calculated to injure it seriously in the eyes of the home government. {40} 'We are in no wise disposed,' they told the king, 'to admit the excellence of the present constitution of Canada, although the present colonial secretary unseasonably and erroneously asserts that the said constitution has conferred on the two Canadas the institutions of Great Britain.'

With an extraordinary lack of tact they assured the king that Toryism was in America 'without any weight or influence except what it derives from its European supporters'; whereas Republicanism 'overspreads all America.' Nor did they stop there. 'This House,' they announced, 'would esteem itself wanting in candour to Your Majesty if it hesitated to call Your Majesty's attention to the fact, that in less than twenty years the population of the United States of America will be greater than that of Great Britain, and that of British America will be greater than that of the former English colonies, when the latter deemed that the time was come to decide that the inappreciable advantage of being self-governed ought to engage them to repudiate a system of colonial government which was, generally speaking, much better than that of British America now is.' This unfortunate reference to the American Revolution, with its {41} hardly veiled threat of rebellion, was scarcely calculated to commend the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the favourable consideration of the British government. And when the Resolutions went on to demand, not merely the removal, but the impeachment of the governor, Lord Aylmer, it must have seemed to unprejudiced bystanders as if the framers of the Resolutions had taken leave of their senses. The Ninety-Two Resolutions do not rank high as a constructive document. The chief change in the constitution which they proposed was the application of the elective principle to the Legislative Council. Of anything which might be construed into advocacy of a statesmanlike project of responsible government there was not a word, save a vague allusion to 'the vicious composition and irresponsibility of the Executive Council.' Papineau and his friends had evidently no conception of the solution ultimately found for the constitutional problem in Canada--a provincial cabinet chosen from the legislature, sitting in the legislature, and responsible to the legislature, whose advice the governor is bound to accept in regard to provincial affairs. Papineau undoubtedly did much to hasten the day of responsible government in Canada; {42} but in this process he was in reality an unwitting agent. The Ninety-Two Resolutions secured a majority of fifty-six to twenty-four. But in the minority voted John Neilson, Augustin Cuvillier, F. A. Quesnel, and Andrew Stuart, who now definitely broke away from Papineau's party. There are signs, too, that the considerable number of Catholic clergy who had openly supported Papineau now began to withdraw from the camp of a leader advocating such republican and revolutionary ideas. There is ground also for believing that not a little unrest disturbed those who voted with Papineau in 1834. In the next year Elzear Bedard, who had moved the Ninety-Two Resolutions, broke with Papineau. Another seceder was Etienne Parent, the editor of the revived _Canadien_, and one of the great figures in French-Canadian literature. Both Bedard and Parent were citizens of Quebec, and they carried with them the great body of public opinion in the provincial capital. It will be observed later that during the disturbances of 1837 Quebec remained quiet. None of the seceders abandoned the demand for the redress of grievances. They merely {43} refused to follow Papineau in his extreme course. For this they were assailed with some of the rhetoric which had hitherto been reserved for the 'Bureaucrats.' To them was applied the opprobrious epithet of _Chouayens_[1]--a name which had been used by Etienne Parent himself in 1828 to describe those French Canadians who took sides with the government party. [1] The name _Chouayen_ or _Chouaguen_ appears to have been first used as a term of reproach at the siege of Oswego in 1756. It is said that after the fall of the forts there to Montcalm's armies a number of Canadian soldiers arrived too late to take part in the fighting. By the soldiers who had borne the brunt of the battle the late-comers were dubbed _Chouaguens_, this being the way the rank and file of the French soldiers pronounced the Indian name of Oswego. Thus the term came to mean one who refuses to follow, or who lets others do the fighting and keeps out of it himself. Perhaps the nearest English, or rather American, equivalent is the name Mugwump. {44} CHAPTER VI THE ROYAL COMMISSION A general election followed soon after the passing of the Ninety-Two Resolutions and revealed the strength of Papineau's position in the country. All those members of the _Patriote_ party who had opposed the Resolutions--Neilson, Cuvillier, Quesnel, Stuart, and two or three others--suffered defeat at the polls. The first division-list in the new Assembly showed seventy members voting for Papineau as speaker, and only six voting against him. The Resolutions were forwarded to Westminster, both through the Assembly's agent in London and through Lord Aylmer, who received the address embodying the Resolutions, despite the fact that they demanded his own impeachment. The British House of Commons appointed a special committee to inquire into the grievances of which the Resolutions complained; but there followed {45} no immediate action by the government. The years 1834 and 1835 saw much disturbance in British politics: there were no less than four successive ministers at the Colonial Office. It was natural that there should be some delay in dealing with the troubles of Lower Canada. In the spring of 1835, however, the government made up its mind about the course to pursue.

The years 1834 and 1835 saw much disturbance in British politics: there were no less than four successive ministers at the Colonial Office. It was natural that there should be some delay in dealing with the troubles of Lower Canada. In the spring of 1835, however, the government made up its mind about the course to pursue. It decided to send to Canada a royal commission for the purpose of investigating, and if possible settling, the questions in dispute. It was thought advisable to combine in one person the office of chief royal commissioner and that of governor of Canada. To clear the way for this arrangement Lord Aylmer was recalled. But he was expressly relieved from all censure: it was merely recognized by the authorities that his unfortunate relations with the Assembly made it unlikely that he would be able to offer any assistance in a solution of the problem. The unenviable position of governor and chief royal commissioner was offered in turn to several English statesmen and declined by all of them. It was eventually accepted by Lord Gosford, an Irish peer without experience in public life. With him were associated as commissioners Sir Charles Grey, afterwards {46} governor of Jamaica, and Sir George Gipps, afterwards governor of New South Wales. These two men were evidently intended to offset each other: Grey was commonly rated as a Tory, while Gipps was a Liberal. Lord Gosford's appointment caused much surprise. He was a stranger in politics and in civil government. There is no doubt that his appointment was a last resource. But his Irish geniality and his facility in being all things to all men were no small recommendations for a governor who was to attempt to set things right in Canada. The policy of Lord Glenelg, the colonial secretary during Gosford's period of office, was to do everything in his power to conciliate the Canadian _Patriotes_, short of making any real constitutional concessions. By means of a conciliatory attitude he hoped to induce them to abate some of their demands. There is, indeed, evidence that he was personally willing to go further: he seems to have proposed to William IV that the French Canadians should be granted, as they desired, an elective Legislative Council; but the staunch old Tory king would not hear of the change. 'The king objects on principle,' the ministers were told, 'and upon what he {47} considers sound constitutional principle, to the adoption of the elective principle in the constitution of the legislative councils in the colonies.' In 1836 the king had not yet become a negligible factor in determining the policy of the government; and the idea was dropped. Lord Gosford arrived in Canada at the end of the summer of 1835 to find himself confronted with a discouraging state of affairs. A short session of the Assembly in the earlier part of the year had been marked by unprecedented violence. Papineau had attacked Lord Aylmer in language breathing passion; and had caused Lord Aylmer's reply to the address of the Assembly containing the Ninety-Two Resolutions to be expunged from the journals of the House as 'an insult cast at the whole nation.' Papineau had professed himself hopeless of any amendment of grievances by Great Britain. 'When Reform ministries, who called themselves our friends,' he said, 'have been deaf to our complaints, can we hope that a Tory ministry, the enemy of Reform, will give us a better hearing? We have nothing to expect from the Tories unless we can inspire them with fear or worry them by ceaseless importunity.' It {48} should be observed, however, that in 1835 Papineau explicitly disclaimed any intention of stirring up civil war. When Gugy, one of the English members of the Assembly,[1] accused him of such an intention, Papineau replied: Mr Gugy has talked to us again about an outbreak and civil war--a ridiculous bugbear which is regularly revived every time the House protests against these abuses, as it was under Craig, under Dalhousie, and still more persistently under the present governor. Doubtless the honourable gentleman, having studied military tactics as a lieutenant in the militia--I do not say as a major, for he has been a major only for the purposes of the parade-ground and the ball-room--is quite competent to judge of the results of a civil war and of the forces of the country, but he need not fancy that he can frighten us by hinting to us that he will fight in the ranks of the enemy. All his threats are futile, and his fears but the creatures of imagination. Papineau did not yet contemplate an appeal {49} to arms; and of course he could not foresee that only two years later Conrad Gugy would be one of the first to enter the village of St Eustache after the defeat of the _Patriote_ forces. In spite of the inflamed state of public feeling, Lord Gosford tried to put into effect his policy of conciliation. He sought to win the confidence of the French Canadians by presiding at their entertainments, by attending the distribution of prizes at their seminaries, and by giving balls on their feast days. He entertained lavishly, and his manners toward his guests were decidedly convivial. '_Milord_,' exclaimed one of them on one occasion, tapping him on the back at a certain stage of the after-dinner conversation, '_milord, vous etes bien aimable_.'

'Pardonnez,' replied Gosford; '_c'est le vin_.' Even Papineau was induced to accept the governor's hospitality, though there were not wanting those who warned Gosford that Papineau was irreconcilable. 'By a wrong-headed and melancholy alchemy,' wrote an English officer in Quebec to Gosford, 'he will transmute every public concession into a demand for more, in a ratio equal to its extent; and his disordered moral palate, beneath the blandest smile and the {50} softest language, will turn your Burgundy into vinegar.' The speech with which Lord Gosford opened the session of the legislature in the autumn of 1835 was in line with the rest of his policy. He announced his determination to effect the redress of every grievance. In some cases the action of the executive government would be sufficient to supply the remedy. In others the assistance of the legislature would be necessary. A third class of cases would call for the sanction of the British parliament. He promised that no discrimination against French Canadians should be made in appointments to office. He expressed the opinion that executive councillors should not sit in the legislature. He announced that the French would be guaranteed the use of their native tongue. He made an earnest plea for the settlement of the financial difficulty, and offered some concessions. The legislature should be given control of the hereditary revenues of the Crown, if provision were made for the support of the executive and the judiciary. Finally, he made a plea for the reconciliation of the French and English races in the country, whom he described as 'the offspring of the two foremost nations {51} of mankind.' Not even the most extreme of the _Patriotes_ could fail to see that Lord Gosford was holding out to them an olive branch. Great dissatisfaction, of course, arose among the English in the colony at Lord Gosford's policy. 'Constitutional associations,' which had been formed in Quebec and Montreal for the defence of the constitution and the rights and privileges of the English-speaking inhabitants of Canada, expressed gloomy forebodings as to the probable result of the policy. The British in Montreal organized among themselves a volunteer rifle corps, eight hundred strong, 'to protect their persons and property, and to assist in maintaining the rights and principles granted them by the constitution'; and there was much indignation when the rifle corps was forced to disband by order of the governor, who declared that the constitution was in no danger, and that, even if it were, the government would be competent to deal with the situation. Nor did Gosford find it plain sailing with all the French Canadians. Papineau's followers in the House took up at first a distinctly independent attitude. Gosford was informed {52} that the appointment of the royal commission was an insult to the Assembly; it threw doubt on the assertions which Papineau and his followers had made in petitions and resolutions. If the report of the commissioners turned out to be in accord with the views of the House, well and good; but if not, that would not influence the attitude of the House. They would not alter their demands. In spite, however, of the uneasiness of the English official element, and the obduracy of the extreme _Patriotes_, it is barely possible that Gosford, with his _bonhomie_ and his Burgundy, might have effected a modus vivendi, had there not occurred, about six months after Gosford's arrival in Canada, one of those unfortunate and unforeseen events which upset the best-laid schemes of mice and men. This was the indiscreet action of Sir Francis Bond Head, the newly appointed lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, in communicating to the legislature of Upper Canada the _ipsissima verba_ of his instructions from the Colonial Office. It was immediately seen that a discrepancy existed between the tenor of Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions and the tenor of Lord Gosford's speech at the opening of the legislature of Lower Canada in 1835. {53} Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions showed beyond peradventure that the British government did not contemplate any real constitutional changes in the Canadas; above all, it did not propose to yield to the demand for an elective Legislative Council. This fact was called to the attention of Papineau and his friends by Marshall Spring Bidwell, the speaker of the Assembly of Upper Canada; and immediately the fat was in the fire. Papineau was confirmed in his belief that justice could not be hoped for; those who had been won over by Gosford's blandishments experienced a revulsion of feeling; and Gosford saw the fruit of his efforts vanishing into thin air. A climax came over the question of supply. Lord Gosford had asked the Assembly to vote a permanent civil list, in view of the fact that the government offered to hand over to the control of the legislature the casual and territorial revenues of the Crown. But the publication of Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions effectually destroyed any hope of this compromise being accepted. In the session of the House which was held in the early part of 1836, Papineau and his friends not only refused to vote a permanent civil {54} list; they declined to grant more than six months' supply in any case; and with this they made the threat that if the demands of the _Patriotes_ were not met at the end of the six months, no more supplies would be voted. This action was deemed so unsatisfactory that the Legislative Council threw out the bill of supply. The result was widespread distress among the public officials of the colony. This was the fourth year in which no provision had been made for the upkeep of government.

This action was deemed so unsatisfactory that the Legislative Council threw out the bill of supply. The result was widespread distress among the public officials of the colony. This was the fourth year in which no provision had been made for the upkeep of government. In 1833 the bill of supply had been so cumbered with conditions that it had been rejected by the Legislative Council. In 1834, owing to disputes between the Executive and the Assembly, the legislature had separated without a vote on the estimates. In 1835 the Assembly had declined to make any vote of supply. In earlier years the Executive had been able, owing to its control of certain royal and imperial revenues, to carry on the government after a fashion under such circumstances; but since it had transferred a large part of these revenues to the control of the legislature, it was no longer able to meet the situation. Papineau and his friends doubtless recognized that they now had the 'Bureaucrats' at their mercy; and {55} they seem to have made up their minds to achieve the full measure of their demands, or make government impossible by withholding the supplies, no matter what suffering this course might inflict on the families of the public servants. In the autumn of 1836 the royal commissioners brought their labours to a close. Lord Gosford, it is true, remained in the colony as governor until the beginning of 1838, and Sir George Gipps remained until the beginning of 1837, but Sir Charles Grey left for England in November 1836 with the last of the commissioners' reports. These reports, which were six in number, exercised little direct influence upon the course of events in Canada. The commissioners pronounced against the introduction of responsible government, in the modern sense of the term, on the ground that it would be incompatible with the status of a colony. They advised against the project of an elective Legislative Council. In the event of a crisis arising, they submitted the question whether the total suspension of the constitution would not be less objectionable than any partial interference with the particular clauses. It is evident from the reports that the commissioners had {56} bravely survived their earlier view that the discontented Canadians might be won over by unctuous blandishments alone. They could not avoid the conclusion that this policy had failed. [1] He was really of Swiss extraction. {57} CHAPTER VII THE RUSSELL RESOLUTIONS When the legislature of Lower Canada met in the autumn of 1836, Lord Gosford earnestly called its attention to the estimates of the current year and the accounts showing the arrears unpaid. Six months, however, had passed by, and there was no sign of the redress of grievances. The royal commission, indeed, had not completed its investigations. The Assembly, therefore, refused once more to vote the necessary supplies. 'In reference to the demand for a supply,' they told the governor, 'relying on the salutary maxim, that the correction of abuses and the redress of grievances ought to precede the grant thereof, we have been of opinion that there is nothing to authorize us to alter our resolution of the last session.' This answer marked the final and indubitable breakdown of the policy of conciliation without concession. This was recognized by {58} Gosford, who soon afterwards wrote home asking to be allowed to resign, and recommending the appointment of a governor whose hands were 'not pledged as mine are to a mild and conciliatory line of policy.' Two alternatives were now open to the British ministers--either to make a complete capitulation to the demands of the _Patriotes_, or to deal with the situation in a high-handed way. They chose the latter course, though with some hesitation and perhaps with regret. On March 6, 1837, Lord John Russell, chancellor of the Exchequer in the Melbourne administration and one of the most liberal-minded statesmen in England, introduced into the House of Commons ten resolutions dealing with the affairs of Canada. These resolutions recited that since 1832 no provision had been made by the Assembly of Lower Canada for defraying the charges for the administration of justice or for the support of the civil government; that the attention of the Assembly had been called to the arrears due; and that the Assembly had declined to vote a supply until its demands for radical political changes were satisfied. The resolutions declared that though both the bodies in question might be improved in respect of their composition, it {59} was inadvisable to grant the demand to make the Legislative Council elective, or to subject the Executive Council to the responsibility demanded by the House of Assembly. In regard to the financial question, the resolutions repeated the offer made by Lord Aylmer and Lord Gosford--namely, to hand over to the Assembly the control of the hereditary, territorial, and casual revenues of the Crown, on condition that the Assembly would grant a permanent civil list. But the main feature of the resolutions was the clause empowering the governor to pay out of the public revenues, without authorization of the Assembly, the moneys necessary for defraying the cost of government in the province up to April 10, 1837.

This, though not exactly a suspension of the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within the competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the claim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive government, through the power of the purse or otherwise. A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these resolutions. Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part in the discussion. Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the Irish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians. Doubtless it seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were victims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry. Sir George Grey, the colleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and William Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support of the resolutions. The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of the Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were comparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by overwhelming majorities. [Illustration: Wolfred Nelson. From a print in the Chateau de Ramezay.] As soon as the passage of the resolutions became known in Canada, Papineau and his friends began to set the heather on fire. On May 7, 1837, the _Patriotes_ held a huge open-air meeting at St Ours, eleven miles above Sorel on the river Richelieu. The chief organizer of the meeting was Dr Wolfred Nelson, a member of the Assembly living in the neighbouring village of St Denis, who was destined to be one of the leaders of the revolt at the end of the year. Papineau himself was present at the meeting and he spoke in his usual violent strain. He submitted a resolution declaring that 'we cannot but {61} consider a government which has recourse to injustice, to force, and to a violation of the social contract, anything else than an oppressive government, a government by force, for which the measure of our submission should henceforth be simply the measure of our numerical strength, in combination with the sympathy we may find elsewhere.' At St Laurent a week later he used language no less dangerous. 'The Russell resolutions,' he cried, 'are a foul stain; the people should not, and will not, submit to them; the people must transmit their just rights to their posterity, even though it cost them their property and their lives to do so.' These meetings were prototypes of many that followed. All over the province the _Patriotes_ met together to protest against what they called 'coercion.' As a rule the meetings were held in the country parishes after church on Sunday, when the habitants were gathered together. Most inflammatory language was used, and flags and placards were displayed bearing such devices as '_Papineau et le systeme electif_,' '_Papineau et l'independence_,' and '_A bas le despotisme_.' Alarmed by such language, Lord Gosford issued on June 15 a proclamation calling on all loyal {62} subjects to discountenance writings of a seditious tendency, and to avoid meetings of a turbulent or political character. But the proclamation produced no abatement in the agitation; it merely offered one more subject for denunciation. During this period Papineau and his friends continually drew their inspiration from the procedure of the Whigs in the American colonies before 1776. The resolutions of the _Patriotes_ recalled the language of the Declaration of Independence. One of the first measures of the Americans had been to boycott English goods; one of the first measures of the _Patriotes_ was a resolution passed at St Ours binding them to forswear the use of imported English goods and to use only the products of Canadian industry. At the short and abortive session of the legislature which took place at the end of the summer of 1837, nearly all the members of the Assembly appeared in clothes made of Canadian frieze. The shifts of some of the members to avoid wearing English imported articles were rather amusing. 'Mr Rodier's dress,' said the Quebec _Mercury_, 'excited the greatest attention, being unique with the exception of a pair of Berlin gloves, viz.: frock coat of {63} granite colored _etoffe du pays_; inexpressibles and vest of the same material, striped blue and white; straw hat, and beef shoes, with a pair of home-made socks, completed the _outre_ attire. Mr Rodier, it was remarked, had no shirt on, having doubtless been unable to smuggle or manufacture one.' But Louis LaFontaine and 'Beau' Viger limited their patriotism, it appears, to the wearing of Canadian-made waistcoats. The imitation of the American revolutionists did not end here. If the New England colonies had their 'Sons of Liberty,' Lower Canada had its '_Fils de la Liberte_'--an association formed in Montreal in the autumn of 1837. And the Lower Canada Patriotes outstripped the New England patriots in the republican character of their utterances. 'Our only hope,' announced _La Minerve_, 'is to elect our governor ourselves, or, in other words, to cease to belong to the British Empire.' A manifesto of some of the younger spirits of the _Patriote_ party, issued on October 1, 1837, spoke of 'proud designs, which in our day must emancipate our beloved country from all human authority except that of the bold democracy residing within its bosom.' To add point to these opinions, there sprang up all over the country {64} volunteer companies of armed _Patriotes_, led and organized by militia officers who had been dismissed for seditious utterances.", "full_doc_id": "doc-ec5f18616309a7011075cbf64aadc51d", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-fe367bc72a82be3c2cacfc81ba72e719", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "some of the younger spirits of the _Patriote_ party, issued on October 1, 1837, spoke of 'proud designs, which in our day must emancipate our beloved country from all human authority except that of the bold democracy residing within its bosom.' To add point to these opinions, there sprang up all over the country {64} volunteer companies of armed _Patriotes_, led and organized by militia officers who had been dismissed for seditious utterances. Naturally, this situation caused much concern among the loyal people of the country. Loyalist meetings were held in Quebec and Montreal, to offset the _Patriote_ meetings; and an attempt was made to form a loyalist rifle corps in Montreal. The attempt failed owing to the opposition of the governor, who was afraid that such a step would merely aggravate the situation. Not even Gosford, however, was blind to the seriousness of the situation. He wrote to the colonial secretary on September 2, 1837, that all hope of conciliation had passed. Papineau's aims were now the separation of Canada from England and the establishment of a republican form of government. 'I am disposed to think,' he concluded, 'that you may be under the necessity of suspending the constitution.' It was at this time that the Church first threw its weight openly against the revolutionary movement. The British government had accorded to Catholics in Canada a measure of liberty at once just and generous; and the bishops and clergy were not slow to see that under a republican form of government, {65} whether as a state in the American Union or as an independent _nation canadienne_, they might be much worse off, and would not be any better off, than under the dominion of Great Britain. In the summer of 1837 Mgr Lartigue, the bishop of Montreal, addressed a communication to the clergy of his diocese asking them to keep the people within the path of duty. In October he followed this up by a Pastoral Letter, to be read in all the churches, warning the people against the sin of rebellion. He held over those who contemplated rebellion the penalties of the Church: 'The present question amounts to nothing less than this--whether you will choose to maintain, or whether you will choose to abandon, the laws of your religion.' The ecclesiastical authorities were roused to action by a great meeting held on October 23, at St Charles on the Richelieu, the largest and most imposing of all the meetings thus far. Five or six thousand people attended it, representing all the counties about the Richelieu. The proceedings were admirably staged. Dr Wolfred Nelson was in the chair, but Papineau was the central figure. A company of armed men, headed by two militia officers who had been dismissed for disloyalty, and {66} drawn up as a guard, saluted every resolution of the meeting with a volley. A wooden pillar, with a cap of liberty on top, was erected, and dedicated to Papineau. At the end of the proceedings Papineau was led up to the column to receive an address. After this all present marched past singing popular airs; and each man placed his hand on the column, swearing to be faithful to the cause of his country, and to conquer or die for her. All this, of course, was comparatively innocent. The resolutions, too, were not more violent than many others which had been passed elsewhere. Nor did Papineau use language more extreme than usual. Many of the _Patriotes_, indeed, considered his speech too moderate. He deprecated any recourse to arms and advised his hearers merely to boycott English goods, in order to bring the government to righteousness. But some of his lieutenants used language which seemed dangerous. Roused by the eloquence of their leader, they went further than he would venture, and advocated an appeal to the arbitrament of war. 'The time has come,' cried Wolfred Nelson, 'to melt our spoons into bullets.' The exact attitude of Papineau during {67} these months of agitation is difficult to determine. He does not seem to have been quite clear as to what course he should pursue. He had completely lost faith in British justice. He earnestly desired the emancipation of Canada from British rule and the establishment of a republican system of government. But he could not make up his mind to commit himself to armed rebellion. 'I must say, however,' he had announced at St Laurent, 'and it is neither fear nor scruple that makes me do so, that the day has not yet come for us to respond to that appeal.' The same attitude is apparent, in spite of the haughty and defiant language, in the letter which he addressed to the governor's secretary in answer to an inquiry as to what he had said at St Laurent: SIR,--The pretension of the governor to interrogate me respecting my conduct at St Laurent on the 15th of May last is an impertinence which I repel with contempt and silence. I, however, take the pen merely to tell the governor that it is false that any of the resolutions adopted at the meeting of the county of Montreal, held at St Laurent {68} on the 15th May last, recommend a violation of the laws, as in his ignorance he may believe, or as he at least asserts.--Your obedient servant, L. J. PAPINEAU.

J. PAPINEAU. At St Charles Papineau was even more precise in repudiating revolution; and there is no evidence that, when rebellion was decided upon, Papineau played any important part in laying the plans. In later years he was always emphatic in denying that the rebellion of 1837 had been primarily his handiwork. 'I was,' he said in 1847, 'neither more nor less guilty, nor more nor less deserving, than a great number of my colleagues.' The truth seems to be that Papineau always balked a little at the idea of armed rebellion, and that he was carried off his feet at the end of 1837 by his younger associates, whose enthusiasm he himself had inspired. He had raised the wind, but he could not ride the whirlwind. [Illustration: South-Western Lower Canada, 1837.] {69} CHAPTER VIII THE DOGS OF WAR As the autumn of 1837 wore on, the situation in Lower Canada began to assume an aspect more and more threatening. In spite of a proclamation from the governor forbidding such meetings, the _Patriotes_ continued to gather for military drill and musketry exercises. Armed bands went about the countryside, in many places intimidating the loyalists and forcing loyal magistrates and militia officers to send in their resignations to the governor. As early as July some of the Scottish settlers at Cote St Joseph, near St Eustache, had fled from their homes, leaving their property to its fate. Several houses at Cote St Mary had been fired upon or broken into. A letter of Sir John Colborne, the commander of the forces in British North America, written on October 6, shows what the state of affairs was at that time: In my correspondence with Col. Eden I have had occasion to refer to the facts {70} and reports that establish the decided character which the agitators have lately assumed. The people have elected the dismissed officers of the militia to command them. At St Ours a pole has been erected in favour of a dismissed captain with this inscription on it, 'Elu par le peuple.' At St Hyacinthe the tri-coloured flag was displayed for several days. Two families have quitted the town in consequence of the annoyance they received from the patriots. Wolfred Nelson warned the patriots at a public meeting to be ready to arm. The tri-coloured flag is to be seen at two taverns between St Denis and St Charles. Many of the tavern-keepers have discontinued their signs and substituted for them an eagle. The bank notes or promissory notes issued at Yamaska have also the same emblem marked on them. Mr Papineau was escorted from Yamaska to St Denis by a numerous retinue, and it is said that 200 or 300 carriages accompanied him on his route. He has attended five public meetings lately; and at one of them La Valtrie, a priest, was insulted in his presence. The occurrence at St Denis was certainly {71} a political affair, a family at St Antoine opposed to the proceedings of W. Nelson, having been annoyed by the same mob that destroyed the house of Madame St Jacques a few hours before the shot was fired from her window. Special animosity was shown toward the Chouayens, those French Canadians who had refused to follow Papineau's lead. P. D. Debartzch, a legislative councillor and a former supporter of Papineau, who had withdrawn his support after the passing of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, was obliged to flee from his home at St Charles; and Dr Quesnel, one of the magistrates of L'Acadie, had his house broken into by a mob that demanded his resignation as magistrate. On November 6 rioting broke out in Montreal. The Doric Club, an organization of the young men of English blood in the city, came into conflict with the French-Canadian _Fils de la Liberte_. Which side provoked the hostilities, it is now difficult to say. Certainly, both sides were to blame for their behaviour during the day. The sons of liberty broke the windows of prominent loyalists; and the members of the Doric Club completely wrecked {72} the office of the _Vindicator_ newspaper. It was only when the Riot Act was read, and the troops were called out, that the rioting ceased. Up to this point the _Patriotes_ had not indulged in any overt acts of armed rebellion. Some of their leaders, it is true, had been laying plans for a revolt. So much is known from the correspondence which passed between the leading _Patriotes_ in Lower Canada and William Lyon Mackenzie, the leader of the rebellion in Upper Canada. Thomas Storrow Brown, one of Papineau's lieutenants, wrote to Mackenzie asking him to start the ball rolling in Upper Canada first, in order to draw off some of the troops which Sir John Colborne had massed in Lower Canada. But all calculations were now upset by events which rapidly precipitated the crisis in the lower province. Soon after the fracas in the streets of Montreal between the Doric Club and the _Fils de la Liberte_, a priest named Quibilier waited on Papineau, and advised him, since his presence in Montreal had become a source of disturbance, to leave the city. Whether he came as an emissary from the ecclesiastical authorities or merely as a friend is not clear. At any rate, Papineau accepted his advice, {73} and immediately set out for St Hyacinthe. The result was most unfortunate.

Whether he came as an emissary from the ecclesiastical authorities or merely as a friend is not clear. At any rate, Papineau accepted his advice, {73} and immediately set out for St Hyacinthe. The result was most unfortunate. The government, thinking that Papineau had left the city for the purpose of stirring up trouble in the Richelieu district, promptly issued warrants for the arrest of Papineau and some of his chief lieutenants, Dr Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, and several others. Meanwhile, on the day that these warrants for arrest were being issued (November 16), a skirmish took place between a small party of British troopers and a band of _Patriotes_ on the road between Chambly and Longueuil--a skirmish which may be described as the Lexington of the Lower Canada rebellion. The troopers, under Lieutenant Ermatinger, had been sent to St Johns to arrest two French Canadians, named Demaray and Davignon, who had been intimidating the magistrates. The arrest had been effected, and the party were on their way back to Montreal, when they were confronted by an armed company of _Patriotes_, under the command of Bonaventure Viger, who demanded the release of the prisoners. A brisk skirmish ensued, in which several on both sides were wounded. The troopers, outnumbered by at least five {74} to one, and having nothing but pistols with which to reply to the fire of muskets and fowling-pieces, were easily routed; and the two prisoners were liberated. The news of this affair spread rapidly through the parishes, and greatly encouraged the _Patriotes_ to resist the arrest of Papineau and his lieutenants. Papineau, Nelson, Brown, and O'Callaghan had all evaded the sheriff's officer, and had taken refuge in the country about the Richelieu, the heart of the revolutionary district. In a day or two word came to Montreal that considerable numbers of armed habitants had gathered at the villages of St Denis and St Charles, evidently with the intention of preventing the arrest of their leaders. The force at St Denis was under the command of Wolfred Nelson, and that at St Charles was under the command of Thomas Storrow Brown. How these self-styled 'generals' came to be appointed is somewhat of a mystery. Brown, at any rate, seems to have been chosen for the position on the spur of the moment. 'A mere accident took me to St Charles,' he wrote afterwards, 'and put me at the head of a revolting force.' Sir John Colborne, who was in command of the British military forces, immediately {75} determined to disperse these gatherings by force and to arrest their leaders. His plan of campaign was as follows. A force consisting of one regiment of infantry, a troop of the Montreal Volunteer Cavalry, and two light field-guns, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, had already been dispatched to Chambly by way of the road on which the rescue of Demaray and Davignon had taken place. This force would advance on St Charles. Another force, consisting of five companies of the 24th regiment, with a twelve-pounder, under Colonel Charles Gore, a Waterloo veteran, would proceed by boat to Sorel. There it was to be joined by one company of the 66th regiment, then in garrison at Sorel, and the combined force would march on St Denis. After having dispersed the rebels at St Denis, which was thought not to be strongly held, the little army was to proceed to St Charles, where it would be joined by the force under Wetherall. At eight o'clock on the evening of November 22, Colonel Gore set out with his men from the barrack-square at Sorel for St Denis. The journey was one of eighteen miles; and in order to avoid St Ours, which was held by the _Patriotes_, Gore turned away from the main {76} road along the Richelieu to make a detour. This led his troops over very bad roads. The night was dark and rain poured down in torrents. 'I got a lantern,' wrote one of Gore's aides-de-camp afterwards, 'fastened it to the top of a pole, and had it carried in front of the column; but what with horses and men sinking in the mud, harness breaking, wading through water and winding through woods, the little force soon got separated, those in the rear lost sight of the light, and great delays and difficulties were experienced. Towards morning the rain changed to snow, it became very cold, and daybreak found the unfortunate column still floundering in the half-frozen mud four miles from St Denis.' Meanwhile word had reached the rebels of the coming of the soldiers. At daybreak Dr Wolfred Nelson had ridden out to reconnoitre, and had succeeded in destroying several bridges. As the soldiers approached St Denis they heard the church bells ringing the alarm; and it was not long before they found that the village was strongly defended. After capturing some of the houses on the outskirts of the village, they were halted by a stockade built across the road covered by a large brick house, well fortified on all sides.

The commander of {77} the troops brought reinforcements up to the firing line, and the twelve-pounder came into action. But the assailants made very little impression on the defence. Although the engagement lasted for more than five hours, the troops succeeded in capturing nothing more than one of the flanking houses. The ammunition of the British was running low, and the numbers of the insurgents seemed to be increasing. Colonel Gore therefore deemed it advisable to retire. By some strange oversight the British were without any ambulance or transport of any kind; and they were compelled to leave their dead and wounded behind them. Their casualties were six killed and eighteen wounded. The wounded, it is a pleasure to be able to say, were well looked after by the victorious _Patriotes_. The British effected their retreat with great steadiness, despite the fact that the men had had no food since the previous day and had been marching all night. They were compelled to abandon their twelve-pounder in the mud; but they reached St Ours that night without further loss. The next day they were back at Sorel. The number of the insurgents at St Denis has never been accurately ascertained; {78} probably they were considerably in excess of the troops. Their position was one of great strength, and good judgment had been shown in fortifying it. On the other hand, with the exception of a few veterans of Major de Salaberry's Voltigeurs, they were untrained in war; and their muskets and fowling-pieces were much inferior to the rifles of the regulars. Their victory, it must be said, reflected great credit upon them; although their losses had been twice as great as those of the soldiers,[1] these peasants in homespun had stood their ground with a courage and steadiness which would have honoured old campaigners. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said about some of their leaders. Papineau and O'Callaghan were present in St Denis when the attack began; but before the morning was well advanced, they had departed for St Hyacinthe, whence they later fled to the United States. Papineau always declared that he had taken this action at the {79} solicitation of Wolfred Nelson, who had said to him: 'Do not expose yourself uselessly: you will be of more service to us after the fight than here.' In later days, however, when political differences had arisen between the two men, Nelson denied having given Papineau any such advice. It is very difficult to know the truth. But even if Nelson did advise Papineau to leave, it cannot be said that Papineau consulted his own reputation in accepting the advice. He was not a person without military experience: he had been a major in the militia, and was probably superior in rank to any one in the village. His place was with the brave farmers who had taken up arms on his behalf. An episode in connection with the attack on St Denis left a dark stain on the _Patriote_ escutcheon and embittered greatly the relations between the two races in Canada. This was the murder, on the morning of the fight, of Lieutenant Weir, a subaltern in the 32nd regiment, who had been sent with dispatches to Sorel by land. He had reached Sorel half an hour after Colonel Gore and his men had departed for St Denis. In attempting to catch up with Gore's column he had taken the direct road to St Denis and had arrived there {80} in advance of the British troops. On approaching the village he was arrested, and by Wolfred Nelson's orders placed in detention. As the British attack developed, it was thought better by those who had him in charge to remove him to St Charles. They bound him tightly and placed him in a wagon. Hardly had they started when he made an attempt to escape. In this emergency his warders seem to have lost their heads. In spite of the fact that Weir was tightly bound and could do no harm, they fell upon him with swords and pistols, and in a short time dispatched him. Then, appalled at what they had done, they attempted to hide the body. When the British troops entered St Denis a week later, they found the body lying, weighted down with stones, in the Richelieu river under about two feet of water. The autopsy disclosed the brutality with which Weir had been murdered; and the sight of the body so infuriated the soldiers that they gave the greater part of the village of St Denis to the flames. In the later phases of the rebellion the slogan of the British soldiers was, 'Remember Jack Weir.' Another atrocious murder even more unpardonable than that of Weir was perpetrated {81} a few days later. On November 28 some _Patriotes_ near St Johns captured a man by the name of Chartrand, who was enlisted in a loyal volunteer corps of the district. After a mock trial Chartrand was tied to a tree and shot by his own countrymen. [1] According to a report twelve _Patriotes_ lost their lives during the engagement. Among them was Charles Ovide Perrault, member of the Assembly for Vaudreuil, a young barrister of considerable promise. He seems to have been Papineau's closest follower and confidant During the last sessions of the Lower Canada legislature Perrault contributed many letters to _La Minerve_. {82} CHAPTER IX _FORCE MAJEURE_ The check administered to Colonel Gore's column at St Denis, in the first engagement of the rebellion, was the only victory which fell to the rebel forces.

He seems to have been Papineau's closest follower and confidant During the last sessions of the Lower Canada legislature Perrault contributed many letters to _La Minerve_. {82} CHAPTER IX _FORCE MAJEURE_ The check administered to Colonel Gore's column at St Denis, in the first engagement of the rebellion, was the only victory which fell to the rebel forces. In the meantime Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, with several companies of infantry, a troop of volunteer cavalry, and two field-guns, was marching on St Charles. On the evening of November 22 Major Gugy, the leader of the English party in the Assembly, had brought to Wetherall at Chambly instructions to advance down the Richelieu and attack the rebel position at St Charles in the morning. He set out accordingly at about the hour when Gore headed his forces up the river from Sorel. But, while Gore carried out his orders to the letter and reached St Denis on the morning of the 23rd, Wetherall allowed himself some latitude in interpreting his instructions. This was largely due to the advice of Gugy, if we are to believe {83} the account which Gugy has left us. 'In the first place,' it runs, 'not one of the force knew anything of the roads or people, nor do I believe that more than one spoke French.... The storm raged so fearfully, the rain poured in such torrents, and the frost set in afterwards so intensely, that ... men and horses were equally fatigued ... all so exhausted as to be unable to cope, on broken or woody ground, successfully with any resolute enemy.... I learned that we had marched without a dollar, without a loaf of bread, without a commissary, and without a spare cartridge--a pretty predicament in an enemy's country, surrounded by thousands of armed men.' It was apparent to Gugy that Sir John Colborne, in issuing his orders, had greatly underestimated the difficulty of the task he was setting for the troops. After crossing the river above the Chambly Basin, Gugy therefore induced Wetherall to halt until daylight; and, turning himself into a commissary, he billeted the men and horses in the neighbouring houses and stables. The next day about noon the column reached St Hilaire, some seven miles from St Charles. Here Wetherall obtained information which led him to fear that Gore {84} had met with some kind of check; and he was persuaded to send back to Chambly for a reinforcement of one company which had been left in garrison there. His messenger reached Chambly at four o'clock on the morning of the 24th. Major Warde, the commandant at Chambly, at once embarked his company on a scow and dropped down the river to St Hilaire; but he arrived too late to allow of any further action that day, and it was not until the morning of the 25th that the column moved on St Charles. Meanwhile, the rebels had been making preparations for defence. They had fortified the manor-house of Debartzch, who had fled to Montreal, and built round it a rampart of earth and tree-trunks--a rampart which, for some mysterious reason, was never completed. They appointed as commander Thomas Storrow Brown, a Montreal iron-merchant, for whose arrest a warrant had been issued and who had fled to St Charles with two or three other _Patriote_ politicians. But Brown had no military experience, and was still suffering so severely from injuries received in the rioting in Montreal that his proper place was a home for convalescents rather than a field of battle. His appointment can only be {85} explained by the non-appearance of the local _Patriote_ leaders. 'The chief men,' Brown testified afterwards, 'were, with two or three exceptions, absent or hiding.' It is evident that the British authorities expected to meet with the strongest opposition at St Charles, since that place had been the scene of the great demonstration earlier in the year. But, as a matter of fact, the rebel forces at St Charles were much less formidable than those at St Denis. Not only were they lacking in proper military leadership; they were also fewer in number and were, moreover, very inadequately armed. If Brown's statements are to be relied upon, there were not in the rebel camp two hundred men. 'Of ammunition,' wrote Brown, 'we had some half dozen kegs of gunpowder and a little lead, which was cast into bullets; but as the fire-arms were of every calibre, the cartridges made were too large for many, which were consequently useless. We had two small rusty field-pieces, but with neither carriages nor appointments they were as useless as two logs. There was one old musket, but not a bayonet. The fire-arms were common flintlocks, in all conditions of dilapidation, some tied together with string, and very many with {86} lock-springs so worn out that they could not be discharged.' On the 24th Brown made a reconnaissance in the direction of St Hilaire. He destroyed a bridge over a ravine some distance to the south of St Charles, and placed above it an outpost with orders to prevent a reconstruction of the bridge. But when the British troops appeared on the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back without making any resistance.

But when the British troops appeared on the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back without making any resistance. They probably saw that they were so outnumbered that resistance would be hopeless. On the approach of the troops Brown at first assumed an attitude of confidence. A messenger came from Wetherall, 'a respectable old habitant,' to tell the rebels that if they dispersed quietly, they would not be molested. Brown treated the message as a confession of weakness. 'I at once supposed,' he said, 'that, followed in the rear by our friends from above, they were seeking a free passage to Sorel, and determined to send a message, that _if they would lay down their arms, they should pass unmolested_.' This message does not seem to have reached its destination. And hardly had the engagement opened when Brown quickly changed his tune. 'To go forward {87} was useless, as I could order nothing but a retreat--without it the people commenced retiring. I tried to rally the little squads, my only hope being in keeping together the fowling-pieces we had collected, but finding, after a long trial, my strength and authority insufficient, I considered my command gone, turned my horse, and rode to ... St Denis (seven or eight miles), where ... I arrived about nightfall.' The engagement lasted less than an hour. The rebels, or at any rate those of them who were armed, seem to have been outnumbered by the soldiers, of whom there were between three and four hundred. But the fighting was apparently brisk while it lasted. The British lost three killed and eighteen wounded. The _Patriote_ losses are not known. The local tradition is that forty-two were killed and many more wounded. We know that thirty were taken prisoners on the field. The defeat of the rebels at St Charles really terminated the rebellion in the country about the Richelieu. When news of the defeat spread over the countryside, the _Patriote_ forces immediately disbanded, and their leaders sought safety in flight. Papineau and O'Callaghan, who had been at St Hyacinthe, {88} succeeded in getting across the Vermont border; but Wolfred Nelson was not so fortunate. After suffering great privations he was captured by some loyalist militia not far from the frontier, taken to Montreal, and there lodged in prison. For some reason which it is difficult to discern, Wetherall did not march on from St Charles to effect a pacification of St Denis. On December 1, however, Colonel Gore once more set out from Sorel, and entered St Denis the same day. He found everything quiet. He recovered the howitzer and five of the wounded men he had left behind. In spite of the absence of opposition, his men took advantage of the occasion to wreak an unfair and un-British vengeance on the helpless victors of yesterday. Goaded to fury by the sight of young Weir's mangled body, they set fire to a large part of the village. Colonel Gore afterwards repudiated the charge that he had ordered the burning of the houses of the insurgents; but that defence does not absolve him from blame. It is obvious, at any rate, that he did not take adequate measures to prevent such excesses; nor was any punishment ever administered to those who applied the torch. {89} But the end of rebellion was not yet in sight. Two more encounters remain to be described. The first of these occurred at a place known as Moore's Corners, near the Vermont border. After the collapse at St Charles a number of _Patriote_ refugees had gathered at the small town of Swanton, a few miles south of Missisquoi Bay, on the American side of the boundary-line. Among them were Dr Cyrile Cote and Edouard Rodier, both members of the Lower Canada Assembly; Ludger Duvernay, a member of the Assembly and editor of _La Minerve_; Dr Kimber, one of the ringleaders in the rescue of Demaray and Davignon; and Robert Shore Milnes Bouchette, the descendant of a French-Canadian family long conspicuous for its loyalty and its services to the state. Bouchette's grandfather had been instrumental in effecting the escape of Sir Guy Carleton from Montreal in 1775, when that place was threatened by the forces of Montgomery. The grandson's social tastes and affiliations might have led one to expect that he would have been found in the ranks of the loyalists; but the arbitrary policy of the Russell Resolutions had driven him into the arms of the extreme _Patriotes_. Arrested for disloyalty at the outbreak of {90} the rebellion, he had been admitted to bail and had escaped. These men, under the belief that the habitants would rise and join them, determined upon an armed invasion of Canada. Possibly they believed also that Wolfred Nelson was still holding out. Papineau, it was said, had reported that 'the victor of St Denis' was entrenched with a considerable force at St Cesaire on the Yamaska. They therefore collected arms and ammunition, sent emissaries through the parishes to the north to rouse the _Patriotes_, and on December 6, flying some colours which had been worked for them by the enthusiastic ladies of Swanton, they crossed the Canadian border, about two hundred strong. They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on Canadian soil. Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and ammunition.

They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on Canadian soil. Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and ammunition. Having received warning of the coming of the insurgents, Kemp had sent out messengers through the countryside to rouse the loyalist {91} population. To these as they arrived he served out the muskets in his wagons. And when the rebels appeared, about eight o'clock at night, he had a force at his disposal of at least three hundred men, all well armed. There is reason for believing that Kemp might have succeeded in ambushing the advancing force, had not some of his men, untrained volunteers with muskets in their hands for the first time, opened fire prematurely. The rebels returned the fire, and a fusillade continued for ten or fifteen minutes. But the rebels, on perceiving that they had met a superior force, retired in great haste, leaving behind them one dead and two wounded. One of the wounded was Bouchette, who had been in command of the advance-guard. The rebels abandoned also their two field-pieces, about forty stand of arms, five kegs of gunpowder, and six boxes of ball-cartridge, as well as two standards. Among the loyalists there were no casualties whatever. Only three of the rebels were taken prisoner besides the two wounded, a fact which Kemp explained by several factors--the undisciplined state of the loyalists, the darkness of the night, the vicinity of woods, and the proximity of the boundary-line, {92} beyond which he did not allow the pursuit to go. The 'battle' of Moore's Corners was in truth an excellent farce; but there is no doubt that it prevented what might have been a more serious encounter had the rebel column reached the neighbourhood of St Johns, where many of the _Patriotes_ were in readiness to join them. A few days later, in a part of the province some distance removed from the Richelieu river and the Vermont border, there occurred another collision, perhaps the most formidable of the whole rebellion. This was at the village of St Eustache, in the county of Two Mountains, about eighteen miles north-west of Montreal. The county of Two Mountains had long been known as a stronghold of the extreme _Patriotes_. The local member, W. H. Scott, was a supporter of Papineau, and had a large and enthusiastic following. He was not, however, a leader in the troubles that ensued. The chief organizer of revolt in St Eustache and the surrounding country was a mysterious adventurer named Amury Girod, who arrived in St Eustache toward the end of November with credentials, it would seem from Papineau, assigning to him the task of superintending the _Patriote_ cause {93} in the north. About Girod very little is known. He is variously described as having been a Swiss, an Alsatian, and a native of Louisiana. According to his own statement, he had been at one time a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry in Mexico. He was well educated, could speak fluently several languages, had a bold and plausible manner, and succeeded in imposing, not only upon the _Patriote_ leaders, but upon the people of St Eustache. He found a capable and dauntless supporter in Dr J. O. Chenier, the young physician of the village. Chenier was one of the few leaders of the revolt whose courage challenges admiration; and it is fitting that to-day a monument, bearing the simple inscription CHENIER, should stand in the Place Viger in Montreal, among the people for whom, though misguidedly and recklessly, he laid down his life. To St Eustache, on Sunday, November 26, came the news of Wolfred Nelson's victory at St Denis. On Monday and Tuesday bands of _Patriotes_ went about the countryside, terrorizing and disarming the loyalists and compelling the faint-hearted to join in the rising. On Wednesday night the rebels gathered to the number of about four hundred {94} in St Eustache, and got noisily drunk (_s'y enivrerent bruyamment_). They then proceeded, under the command of Girod and Chenier, to the Indian mission settlement at the Lake of Two Mountains. Here they broke into the government stores and possessed themselves of some guns and ammunition. They next made themselves unwelcome to the superior of the mission, the Abbe Dufresne, and, in spite of his protestations, carried off from the mission-house a three-pounder gun. On their return to St Eustache they forcibly entered the convent which had been lately completed, though it was not yet occupied, and camped there. The loyalists who were forced to flee from the village carried the news of these proceedings to Montreal; but Sir John Colborne was unwilling to take any steps to subdue the _Patriotes_ of St Eustache until the insurrection on the Richelieu had been thoroughly crushed.

All he did was to send a detachment of volunteers to guard the Bord a Plouffe bridge at the northern end of the island of Montreal. On Sunday, December 3, word reached St Eustache of the defeat of the insurgents at St Charles. This had a moderating influence on many of the _Patriotes_. All week the Abbe {95} Paquin, parish priest of St Eustache, had been urging the insurgents to go back quietly to their homes. He now renewed his exhortations. He begged Chenier to cease his revolutionary conduct. Chenier, however, was immovable. He refused to believe that the rebels at St Charles had been dispersed, and announced his determination to die with arms in his hands rather than surrender. 'You might as well try to seize the moon with your teeth,' he exclaimed, 'as to try to shake my resolve.' The events of the days that followed cannot be chronicled in detail. When the Abbe Paquin and his vicar Deseves sought to leave the parish, Girod and Chenier virtually placed them under arrest. The abbe did not mince matters with Chenier. 'I accuse you before God and man,' he said, 'of being the author of these misfortunes.' When some of the habitants came to him complaining that they had been forced against their will to join the rebels, he reminded them of the English proverb: 'You may lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.' Unfortunately, the Abbe Paquin's good influence was counteracted by that of the Abbe Chartier, the cure of the neighbouring village of St {96} Benoit, a rare case of an ecclesiastic lending his support to the rebel movement, in direct contravention of the orders of his superiors. On several occasions the Abbe Chartier came over to St Eustache and delivered inflammatory addresses to the rebel levies. The vicar Deseves has left us a vivid picture of the life which the rebels led. No attempt was made to drill them or to exercise discipline. Time hung heavy on their hands. He continually saw them, he says, passing through the village in knots of five or six, carrying rusty guns out of order, smoking short black pipes, and wearing blue _tuques_ which hung half-way down their backs, clothes of _etoffe du pays_, and leather mittens. They helped themselves to all the strong drink they could lay their hands on, and their gait showed the influence of their potations. Their chief aim in life seemed to be to steal, to drink, to eat, to dance, and to quarrel. With regard to the morrow, they lived in a fool's paradise. They seem to have believed that the troops would not dare to come out to meet them, and that when their leaders should give the word they would advance on Montreal and take it without difficulty. Their numbers during this period showed a good deal of {97} fluctuation. Ultimately Girod succeeded in gathering about him nearly a thousand men. Not all these, however, were armed; according to Deseves a great many of them had no weapons but sticks and stones. By December 13 Sir John Colborne was ready to move. He had provided himself with a force strong enough to crush an enemy several times more numerous than the insurgents led by Girod and Chenier. His column was composed of the 1st Royals, the 32nd regiment, the 83rd regiment, the Montreal Volunteer Rifles, Globensky and Leclerc's Volunteers, a strong force of cavalry--in all, over two thousand men, supported by eight pieces of field artillery and well supplied with provision and ammunition transport. The troops bivouacked for the night at St Martin, and advanced on the morning of the 14th. The main body crossed the Mille Isles river on the ice about four miles to the east of St Eustache, and then moved westward along the St Rose road. A detachment of Globensky's Volunteers, however, followed the direct road to St Eustache, and came out on the south side of the river opposite the village, in full view of the rebels. Chenier, at the head of a hundred and fifty men, crossed the {98} ice, and was on the point of coming to close quarters with the volunteers when the main body of the loyalists appeared to the east. Thereupon Chenier and his men beat a hasty retreat, and made hurried preparations for defending the village. The church, the convent, the presbytery, and the house of the member of the Assembly, Scott, were all occupied and barricaded. It was about the church that the fiercest fighting took place. The artillery was brought to bear on the building; but the stout masonry resisted the battering of the cannon balls, and is still standing, dinted and scarred. Some of the Royals then got into the presbytery and set fire to it. Under cover of the smoke the rest of the regiment then doubled up the street to the church door. Gaining access through the sacristy, they lit a fire behind the altar. 'The firing from the church windows then ceased,' wrote one of the officers afterwards, 'and the rebels began running out from some low windows, apparently of a crypt or cellar. Our men formed up on one side of the church, and the 32nd and 83rd on the other. Some of the rebels ran out and fired at the troops, then threw down their arms and begged for quarter. Our officers tried to save the {99} Canadians, but the men shouted \"Remember Jack Weir,\" and numbers of these poor deluded fellows were shot down.' One of those shot down was Chenier.

Our officers tried to save the {99} Canadians, but the men shouted \"Remember Jack Weir,\" and numbers of these poor deluded fellows were shot down.' One of those shot down was Chenier. He had jumped from a window of the Blessed Virgin's chapel and was making for the cemetery. How many fell with him it is difficult to say. It was said that seventy rebels were killed, and a number of charred bodies were found afterwards in the ruins of the church. The casualties among the troops were slight, one killed and nine wounded. One of the wounded was Major Gugy, who here distinguished himself by his bravery and kind-heartedness, as he had done in the St Charles expedition. Many of the rebels escaped. A good many, indeed, had fled from the village on the first appearance of the troops. Among these were some who had played a conspicuous part in fomenting trouble. The Abbe Chartier of St Benoit, instead of waiting to administer the last rites to the dying, beat a feverish retreat and eventually escaped to the United States. The Church placed on him its interdict, and he never again set foot on Canadian soil. The behaviour of the adventurer Girod, the 'general' of the rebel force, was especially {100} reprehensible. When he had posted his men in the church and the surrounding buildings, he mounted a horse and fled toward St Benoit. At a tavern where he stopped to get a stiff draught of spirits he announced that the rebels had been victorious and that he was seeking reinforcements with which to crush the troops completely. For four days he evaded capture. Then, finding that the cordon was tightening around him, he blew out his brains with a revolver. Thus ended a life which was not without its share of romance and mystery. On the night of the 14th the troops encamped near the desolate village of St Eustache, a large part of which had unfortunately been given over to the flames during the engagement. In the morning the column set out for St Benoit. Sir John Colborne had threatened that if a single shot were fired from St Benoit the village would be given over to fire and pillage. But when the troops arrived there they found awaiting them about two hundred and fifty men bearing white flags. All the villagers laid down their arms and made an unqualified submission. And it is a matter for profound regret that, notwithstanding this, the greater part of the village {101} was burned to the ground. Sir John Colborne has been severely censured for this occurrence, and not without reason. Nothing is more certain, of course, than that he did not order it. It seems to have been the work of the loyalist volunteers, who had without doubt suffered much at the hands of the rebels. 'The irregular troops employed,' wrote one of the British officers, 'were not to be controlled, and were in every case, I believe, the instrument of the infliction.' Far too much burning and pillaging went on, indeed, in the wake of the rebellion. 'You know,' wrote an inhabitant of St Benoit to a friend in Montreal, 'where the younger Arnoldi got his supply of butter, or where another got the guitar he carried back with him from the expedition about the neck.' And it is probable that the British officers, and perhaps Sir John Colborne himself, winked at some things which they could not officially recognize. At any rate, it is impossible to acquit Colborne of all responsibility for the unsoldierly conduct of the men under his command. It is usual to regard the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada as no less a fiasco than its counterpart in Upper Canada. There is no doubt that it was hopeless from the outset. {102} It was an impromptu movement, based upon a sudden resolution rather than on a well-reasoned plan of action. Most of the leaders--Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Robert Bouchette, and Amury Girod--were strangers to the men under their command; and none of them, save Chenier, seemed disposed to fight to the last ditch. The movement at its inception fell under the official ban of the Church; and only two priests, the cures of St Charles and St Benoit, showed it any encouragement. The actual rebellion was confined to the county of Two Mountains and the valley of the Richelieu. The districts of Quebec and Three Rivers were quiet as the grave--with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional village like Montmagny, where Etienne P. Tache, afterwards a colleague of Sir John Macdonald and prime minister of Canada, was the centre of a local agitation. Yet it is easy to see that the rebellion might have been much more serious. But for the loyal attitude of the ecclesiastical authorities, and the efforts of many clear-headed parish priests like the Abbe Paquin of St Eustache, the revolutionary leaders might have been able to consummate their plans, and Sir John Colborne, with the small number of troops at {103} his disposal, might have found it difficult to keep the flag flying. The rebellion was easily snuffed out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to the voice of their Church, set their faces against it. {104} CHAPTER X THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public opinion in the mother country.

The rebellion was easily snuffed out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to the voice of their Church, set their faces against it. {104} CHAPTER X THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public opinion in the mother country. That the first year of the reign of the young Queen Victoria should have been marred by an armed revolt in an important British colony shocked the sensibilities of Englishmen and forced the country and the government to realize that the grievances of the Canadian Reformers were more serious than they had imagined. It was clear that the old system of alternating concession and repression had broken down and that the situation demanded radical action. The Melbourne government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada for three years, and appointed the Earl of Durham as Lord High Commissioner, with very full powers, to go out to Canada to investigate the grievances and to report on a remedy. John George Lambton, the first Earl of {105} Durham, was a wealthy and powerful Whig nobleman, of decided Liberal, if not Radical, leanings. He had taken no small part in the framing of the Reform Bill of 1832, and at one time he had been hailed by the English Radicals or Chartists as their coming leader. It was therefore expected that he would be decently sympathetic with the Reform movements in the Canadas. At the same time, Melbourne and his ministers were only too glad to ship him out of the country. There was no question of his great ability and statesmanlike outlook. But his advanced Radical views were distasteful to many of his former colleagues; and his arrogant manners, his lack of tact, and his love of pomp and circumstance made him unpopular even in his own party. The truth is that he was an excellent leader to work under, but a bad colleague to work with. The Melbourne government had first got rid of him by sending him to St Petersburg as ambassador extraordinary; and then, on his return from St Petersburg, they got him out of the way by sending him to Canada. He was at first loath to go, mainly on the ground of ill health; but at the personal intercession of the young queen he accepted the commission offered him. It was {106} an evil day for himself, but a good day for Canada, when he did so. Durham arrived in Quebec, with an almost regal retinue, on May 28, 1838. Gosford, who had remained in Canada throughout the rebellion, had gone home at the end of February; and the administration had been taken over by Sir John Colborne, the commander-in-chief of the forces. As soon as the news of the suspension of the constitution reached Lower Canada, Sir John Colborne appointed a provisional special council of twenty-two members, half of them French and half of them English, to administer the affairs of the province until Lord Durham should arrive. The first official act of Lord Durham in the colony swept this council out of existence. 'His Excellency believes,' the members of the council were told, 'that it is as much the interest of you all, as for the advantage of his own mission, that his administrative conduct should be free from all suspicions of political influence or party feeling; that it should rest on his own undivided responsibility, and that when he quits the Province, he should leave none of its permanent residents in any way committed by the acts which his Government may have {107} found it necessary to perform, during the temporary suspension of the Constitution.' In its place he appointed a small council of five members, all but one from his own staff. The one Canadian called to this council was Dominick Daly, the provincial secretary, whom Colborne recommended as being unidentified with any political party. The first great problem with which Lord Durham and his council had to deal was the question of the political prisoners, numbers of whom were still lying in the prisons of Montreal. Sir John Colborne had not attempted to decide what should be done with them, preferring to shift this responsibility upon Lord Durham. It would probably have been much better to have settled the matter before Lord Durham set foot in the colony, so that his mission might not have been handicapped at the outset with so thorny a problem; but it is easy to follow Colborne's reasoning. In the first place, he did not bring the prisoners to trial because no Lower-Canadian jury at that time could have been induced to convict them, a reasonable inference from the fact that the murder of Weir had gone unavenged, even as the murderers of Chartrand were to be acquitted {108} by a jury a few months later. In the second place, Colborne had not the power to deal with the prisoners summarily. Moreover, most of the rebel leaders had not been captured. The only three prisoners of much importance were Wolfred Nelson, Robert Bouchette, and Bonaventure Viger. The rest of the _Patriote_ leaders were scattered far and wide. Chenier and Girod lay beneath the springing sod; Papineau, O'Callaghan, Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson, Cote, and Rodier were across the American border; Morin had just come out of his hiding-place in the Canadian backwoods; and LaFontaine, after vainly endeavouring, on the outbreak of rebellion, to get Gosford to call together the legislature of Lower Canada, had gone abroad. The future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further disturbances. And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by Durham. Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy.

The future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further disturbances. And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by Durham. Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy. His own instincts were apparently in favour of a complete amnesty; but he supposed it necessary to make an {109} example of some of the leaders. After earnest deliberation and consultation with his council, and especially with his chief secretary, Charles Buller, the friend and pupil of Thomas Carlyle, Durham determined to grant to the rebels a general amnesty, with only twenty-four exceptions. Eight of the men excepted were political prisoners who had been prominent in the revolt and who had confessed their guilt and had thrown themselves on the mercy of the Lord High Commissioner; the remaining sixteen were rebel leaders who had fled from the country. Durham gave orders that the eight prisoners should be transported to the Bermudas during the queen's pleasure. The sixteen refugees were forbidden to return to Canada under penalty of death without benefit of clergy. No one can fail to see that this course was dictated by the humanest considerations. A criminal rebellion had terminated without the shedding judicially of a drop of blood. Lord Durham even took care that the eight prisoners should not be sent to a convict colony. The only criticism directed against his course in Canada was on the ground of its excessive lenity. Wolfred Nelson and Robert Bouchette had certainly suffered a milder fate {110} than that of Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, who had been hanged in Upper Canada for rebellion. Yet when the news of Durham's action reached England, it was immediately attacked as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The assault was opened by Lord Brougham, a bitter personal enemy of Lord Durham. In the House of Lords Brougham contended that Durham had had no right to pass sentence on the rebel prisoners and refugees when they had not been brought to trial; and that he had no right to order them to be transported to, and held in, Bermuda, where his authority did not run. In this attitude he was supported by the Duke of Wellington, the leader of the Tory party. Wellington's name is one which is usually remembered with honour in the history of the British Empire; but on this occasion he did not think it beneath him to play fast and loose with the interests of Canada for the sake of a paltry party advantage. It would have been easy for him to recognize the humanity of Durham's policy, and to join with the government in legislating away any technical illegalities that may have existed in Durham's ordinance; but Wellington could not resist the temptation to embarrass the Whig {111} administration, regardless of the injury which he might be doing to the sorely tried people of Canada. The Melbourne administration, which had sent Durham to Canada, might have been expected to stand behind him when he was attacked. Lord John Russell, indeed, rose in the House of Commons and made a thoroughgoing defence of Durham's policy as 'wise and statesmanlike.' But he alone of the ministers gave Durham loyal support. In the House of Lords Melbourne contented himself with a feeble defence of Durham and then capitulated to the Opposition. Nothing would have been easier for him than to introduce a bill making valid whatever may have been irregular in Durham's ordinance; but instead of that he disallowed the ordinance, and passed an Act of Indemnity for all those who had had a part in carrying it out. Without waiting to hear Durham's defence, or to consult with him as to the course which should be followed, the Cabinet weakly surrendered to an attack of his personal enemies. Durham was betrayed in the house of his friends. The news of the disallowance of the ordinance first reached Durham through the columns of an American newspaper. {112} Immediately his mind was made up. Without waiting for any official notification, he sent in his resignation to the colonial secretary. He was quite satisfied himself that he had not exceeded his powers. 'Until I learn,' he wrote, 'from some one better versed in the English language that despotism means anything but such an aggregation of the supreme executive and legislative authority in a single head, as was deliberately made by Parliament in the Act which constituted my powers, I shall not blush to hear that I have exercised a despotism; I shall feel anxious only to know how well and wisely I have used, or rather exhibited an intention of using, my great powers.' But he felt that if he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him. He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had completed the inquiries he had instituted. In view of the 'lamentable want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself if he left his inquiry incomplete.' A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation, and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to Canadian public opinion.

The wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended by Charles Duller. The general unpopularity of the British government, Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with whom they could agree. The real justification of the proclamation lay in the magical effect which it had upon the public temper. The news that the ordinance had been disallowed, and that the whole question of the political prisoners had been once more thrown into the melting-pot, had greatly excited the public mind; and the proclamation fell like oil upon the troubled waters. 'No disorder, no increase of disaffection ensued; on the contrary, all parties in the Province expressed a revival of confidence.' Lord Durham left Quebec on November 1, {114} 1838. 'It was a sad day and a sad departure,' wrote Buller. 'The streets were crowded. The spectators filled every window and every house-top, and, though every hat was raised as we passed, a deep silence marked the general grief for Lord Durham's departure.' Durham had been in Canada only five short months. Yet in that time he had gained a knowledge of, and an insight into, the Canadian situation such as no other governor of Canada had possessed. The permanent monument of that insight is, of course, his famous _Report on the Affairs of British North America_, issued by the Colonial Office in 1839. This is no place to write at length about that greatest of all documents ever published with regard to colonial affairs. This much, however, may be said. In the _Report_ Lord Durham rightly diagnosed the evils of the body politic in Canada. He traced the rebellion to two causes, in the main: first, racial feeling; and, secondly, that 'union of representative and irresponsible government' of which he said that it was difficult to understand how any English statesman ever imagined that such a system would work. And yet one of the two chief remedies which he recommended seemed like a death sentence passed on the French in Canada. {115} This was the proposal for the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada with the avowed object of anglicizing by absorption the French population. This suggestion certainly did not promote racial peace. The other proposal, that of granting to the Canadian people responsible government in all matters not infringing 'strictly imperial interests,' blazed the trail leading out of the swamps of pre-rebellion politics. In one respect only is Lord Durham's _Report_ seriously faulty: it is not fair to French Canadians. 'They cling,' wrote Durham, 'to ancient prejudices, ancient customs, and ancient laws, not from any strong sense of their beneficial effects, but with the unreasoning tenacity of an uneducated and unprogressive people.' To their racial and nationalist ambitions he was far from favourable. 'The error,' he contended, 'to which the present contest is to be attributed is the vain endeavour to preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the midst of Anglo-American colonies and states'; and he quoted with seeming approval the statement of one of the Lower Canada 'Bureaucrats' that 'Lower Canada must be _English_, at the expense, if necessary, of not being _British_.' His primary {116} object in recommending the union of the two Canadas, to place the French in a minority in the united province, was surely a mistaken policy. Fortunately, it did not become operative. Lord Elgin, a far wiser statesman, who completed Durham's work by introducing the substance of responsible government which the _Report_ recommended, decidedly opposed anything in the nature of a gradual crusade against French-Canadian nationalism. 'I for one,' he wrote, 'am deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to denationalize the French. Generally speaking, they produce the opposite effect, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity to burn more fiercely. But suppose them to be successful, what would be the result? You may perhaps _Americanize_, but, depend upon it, by methods of this description you will never _Anglicize_ the French inhabitants of the province. Let them feel, on the other hand, that their religion, their habits, their prepossessions, their prejudices if you will, are more considered and respected here than in other portions of this vast continent, and who will venture to say that the last hand which waves the British flag on American ground may not be that of a French Canadian?' {117} CHAPTER XI THE SECOND REBELLION The frigate _Inconstant_, with Lord Durham on board, was not two days out from Quebec when rebellion broke out anew in Lower Canada. This second rebellion, however, was not caused by Lord Durham's departure, but was the result of a long course of agitation which had been carried on along the American border throughout the months of Lord Durham's regime. As early as February 1838 numbers of Canadian refugees had gathered in the towns on the American side of the boundary-line in the neighbourhood of Lake Champlain. They were shown much sympathy and encouragement by the Americans, and seem to have laboured under the delusion that the American government would come to their assistance. A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson, declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member. The identity of the other members is a mystery. Papineau seems to have had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off negotiations.

A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson, declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member. The identity of the other members is a mystery. Papineau seems to have had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off negotiations. 'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and this through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and inveterate love of the old French bad laws.' There is reason to believe, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the authorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and Cote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was not ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality. On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border with an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small field-pieces. Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and a junction with another invading force at Three Rivers. But on finding their way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty retreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by the American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer who had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston Heights in 1812. During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay plans for an insurrection in Lower Canada. Emissaries had been constantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont frontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the United States. The rising was carefully planned. And when November came large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St Charles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois. They had apparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these places by American sympathizers with arms and supplies. No such aid being found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes. But some persevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their backs to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line, which had been designated as the rebel headquarters. Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the American side of the border with a small band of refugees. {120} Among these were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had been inveigled into joining the expedition. Hindenlang, who afterwards paid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of what happened. He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west side of Lake Champlain. With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had been placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the river to the Canadian border. There were five in the party--Nelson and the two French officers, the guide, and the boatman. Nelson had given Hindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would be greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic recruits. In this, however, he was disappointed. 'There was not a single man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional Government_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much trouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the arms.' On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville. Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three hundred men. A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was proclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.' Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great astonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force was that of brigadier-general. The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of reinforcements and in gathering arms. By the 7th Nelson had collected a force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in companies and divisions. Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks and pikes. An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the attack and taken seventy prisoners. On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and ammunition from the American sympathizers. On his way south Cote encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at Lacolle, and drove it {122} in. On his return journey, however, he met with greater opposition. The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford. As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove them from the field. Without further ado the rebels fled across the border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.

Without further ado the rebels fled across the border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes. Of the provincial troops two were killed and one was severely wounded. The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of communications with his base on the American frontier was cut. At the same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and volunteers. Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on Odelltown, just north of the border. He had with him about a thousand men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets. {123} He arrived at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor. He had no difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself proved a harder nut to crack. Taylor had concentrated his little force at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three days before at Lacolle. The insurgents extended through the fields to the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range. 'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang; 'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow, praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many saints, hewn in stone. Many remained in that posture as long as the fighting lasted.' The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men had been intimidated into joining the rebel force. The engagement lasted in all about two hours and a half. The defenders of the church made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture. The rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang. Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch and rode for the American border. The losses of the rebels were serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many wounded. Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and one officer and eight men wounded. Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable force, entered Napierville. On his approach those rebels who were still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes. Detachments of troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported to be still under arms. The only encounter took place at Beauharnois, where a large body of insurgents had assembled. After a slight resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of Royal Engineers. In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers, did a good deal of burning and harrying. After the victory at {125} Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village, including the houses of some loyal citizens. In view of the intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused. But no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities. There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels' burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's second-in-command. Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the offenders. The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week. It was a venture criminally hopeless. Failing important aid from the United States, the rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had been considerably increased in number. The chief responsibility for the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126} the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which he had led them. As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the hands of the authorities. Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred were brought to trial. Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially convened for the purpose. Twelve of them, including the French officer Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed. Most of the others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia. It is worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been persons of note in the political arena before 1837", "full_doc_id": "doc-ec5f18616309a7011075cbf64aadc51d", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-3e6059f7b6685e9fbba6db55d93c65ee", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "where they would have the benefit of trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially convened for the purpose.

It is worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been persons of note in the political arena before 1837. On the whole, it must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation. It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some {127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence. And the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on the part of the government. {128} CHAPTER XII A POSTSCRIPT The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past. The _Patriotes_ and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which inspired them. The time has come when Canadians should take an impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to recognize the good and the bad on either side. It is absurd to pretend that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_ leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants they had misled. On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the French-Canadian Church. Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like Robert Bouchette. 'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however remote.' The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they have been made free. [Illustration: Denis Benjamin Viger. From a print in M'Gill University Library.] The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying fortunes. Some of them never returned to Canada. Robert Nelson took up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his death in 1873. E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37. Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin administration, and returned to Canada. Many of these, as well as many of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and prominence in the public service of Canada. Louis Hippolyte LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was knighted by Queen Victoria. Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131} of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin administration. George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was made a baronet by his sovereign. Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his practice in Montreal in 1842. In 1844 he was elected member of parliament for the county of Richelieu. In 1851 he was appointed an inspector of prisons. Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal, took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.

Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs at Ottawa. Papineau returned to Canada in 1845. The greater part of his period of exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the 'red republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848. He entered the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854. {132} But he proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things under responsible government. Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine, who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach. The truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition. That he himself realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an opposition boat.' His real importance after his return to Canada lay not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti Rouge_. In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the _Patriote_ party of 1837. Papineau's later days were quiet and dignified. He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at Montebello and devoted himself to his books. With many of his old antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation. Only on rare occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country.... Opinions outside may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.' And charity covereth a multitude of sins. {134} BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of the general histories of Canada. William Kingsford, _History of Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and interesting. F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with sympathy and power. A work which holds the scales very evenly is Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_ (1848-55). Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of original material of first-rate importance. Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of mention. L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its complete biographies of the leaders in the movement. L. N. Carrier, _Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_. Globensky, _La Rebellion de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value. Lord Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military operations. The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_ (1839). For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North America_. A few biographies may be consulted with advantage. N. E. Dionne, _Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period; as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_ (_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol. ii). See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada' series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of Durham_ (1906). The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county. An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39; exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_ (1839). {136} INDEX Assembly, the language question in the, 8-12; racial conflict over form of taxation, 13-14; the struggle with Executive for full control of revenue leads to deadlock, 22-5, 27, 29-30, 53-4, 57; seeks redress in Imperial parliament, 28-32; the Ninety-Two Resolutions, 38-42; the grievance commission, 45-6, 52, 55-6; the Russell", "full_doc_id": "doc-ec5f18616309a7011075cbf64aadc51d", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-2b195a27b43ec85da2d0175fa01cef0d", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "question in the, 8-12; racial conflict over form of taxation, 13-14; the struggle with Executive for full control of revenue leads to deadlock, 22-5, 27, 29-30, 53-4, 57; seeks redress in Imperial parliament, 28-32; the Ninety-Two Resolutions, 38-42; the grievance commission, 45-6, 52, 55-6; the Russell Resolutions, 57-61.

Goodhue could revisit the earth and make a tour among the daily newspaper offices of St. Paul he would discover that wonderful strides had been made in the method of producing a newspaper during the latter half of the past century. Among the first things to attract the attention of this old-timer would be the web-perfecting press, capable of producing 25,000 impressions an hour, instead of the old hand press of 240 impressions an hour; the linotype machine, capable of setting 6,000 to 10,000 ems per hour, instead of the old hand compositor producing only 800 to 1,000 ems per hour, and the mailing machine, enabling one man to do the work of five or six under the old method. Think of getting out the Sunday Pioneer Press with the material in use fifty years ago. It would take 600 hand presses, 600 hand pressmen and 600 boys three hours to print the edition, and as there were no means of stereotyping in those days the forms would have to be set up 600 times, requiring the services of 5,000 compositors. Papers printed under these conditions would have to be sold for one dollar each, and there would not be much profit in it at that. The first daily papers printed in St. Paul were not conducted or a very gigantic scale, as the entire force of one office generally consisted of one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors and a business manager. A few reminiscences of the trials and tribulations of the early newspaper manager, editor and compositor may not be wholly devoid of interest. In 1857 there occurred in Minnesota an election of delegates to the constitutional convention to provide for the admission of Minnesota into the galaxy of states. The election was so close, politically, that when the delegates met there was a division, and the Republicans and Democrats held separate conventions. At the conclusion of the work of the two conventions the contract for printing was awarded to the two leading papers of the state--the Pioneer and the Minnesotian--the Pioneer to print the proceedings of the Democratic body and the Minnesotian that of the Republican. This contract called for the expenditure of considerable money for material with which to perform the work. Mr. Moore, the business manager of the Minnesotian, went to New York and purchased a Hoe press, the first one ever brought to the state, and a large quantity of type; also a Hoe proof press, which is still in use in the Pioneer Press composing room. When the book was about completed the business manager of the Minnesotian was informed that an injunction had been issued prohibiting him from drawing any money from the state until the question of the right of the Minnesotian to do any state printing had been determined by the district court. Mr. Goodrich was state printer and claimed he had a right to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies. This action on the part of the Pioneer produced great consternation in the Minnesotian office, as most of the men had not received more than half pay for some time, and now, when the balance of their pay was almost in sight, they were suddenly compelled to await the slow and doubtful action of the courts before receiving pay for their summer's work. The district court, subsequently confirmed by the supreme court, decided in favor of the Minnesotian, and the day following the decision Mr. Moore, of the Minnesotian, brought down a bag of gold from the capitol containing $4,000, and divided it up among his employes. In 1858, when the first Atlantic cable was laid, the news was anxiously looked for, and nearly every inhabitant of the city turned out to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the fastest boats on the river, which were expected to bring the news of the successful laying of the cable. The Gray Eagle started from Dubuque at 9 o'clock in the morning and the Itasca started from Prairie du Chien, about 100 miles farther up the river, at noon of the same day. When the boats reached the bend below the river they were abreast of each other, and as they reached the levee it was hardly possible to tell which was ahead. One of the passengers on the Gray Eagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message, tied up with a small stone on the inside of it, and as he threw it to the shore a messenger from the Minnesotian caught it and ran up Bench street to the Minnesotian office, where the printers were waiting, and the Minnesotian had the satisfaction of getting out an extra some little time before their competitors. In the summer season the newspapers had to rely, to a considerable extent, on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for telegraph news. There were three or four daily lines of steamers to St. Paul, and every one of them could be distinguished by its whistle. When it was time for the arrival of the boat bringing the newspapers from which the different papers expected to get their telegraphic news, messengers from the different offices would be at the levee, and as the boat neared the shore they would leap for the gangplank, and there was always a scramble to get to the clerk's office first. James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee awaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies of the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the adventurous kids from the newspaper offices. The Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the name of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county,", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-46289654522dd0ee1ffdeb77be06722d", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "clerk's office first. James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee awaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies of the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the adventurous kids from the newspaper offices. The Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the name of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov. Sibley called out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the lynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy. The Pioneer Guards was the crack military company of the state, and the only service any of its members ever expected to do was in the ballroom or to participate in a Fourth of July parade. When they were called out by the governor there was great consternation in the ranks. One of the members, who is still a prominent politician in the city, when told that his first duty was to serve his country, tremblingly remarked that he thought his first duty was to provide for his wife and family. A number of them made their wills before departing, as they thought the whole of Wright county was in open rebellion. After being absent for about a week they proudly marched back to the city without ever firing a gun or seeing an enemy. The late J. Fletcher Williams was city editor of the Minnesotian, and he wrote an extended account of the expedition, and It was profusely illustrated with patent medicine cuts and inverted wood type and border, the only available material at that time that could be procured. The year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of Minnesota. Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, both now living in this city, were the rival candidates for governor. The Republicans made extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative tickets, as both governor and United States senator were at stake. Among the speakers imported by the Republicans were the Hon. Galusha A. Grow of Pennsylvania and Hon. Schuyler Colfax of Indiana. Mr. Grow, then as now, represented the congressional district in Pennsylvania in which I formally resided, and I was very anxious to hear him, as the first political speech I had ever heard was made by him in a small village in Pennsylvania. The speakers were announced to speak at the old People's theater, on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, and I was among the first to enter. The theater was packed to overflowing. Mr. Grow had made a very interesting speech of about an hour's duration, and Mr. Colfax was to follow for an equal length of time. After Mr. Colfax had spoken about ten minutes an alarm of fire was sounded and in less than fifteen minutes the entire structure was burned to the ground. This happened about 9:30 o'clock in the evening, and, strange to relate, not one of the morning papers had an announcement of the fact the next day. The morning papers at that time were something like an evening paper of to-day. They were set up and made up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of the evening. The result of that election was very gratifying to the Republicans. I can see old Dr. Foster now writing a double column political head for the Minnesotian, the first two lines of which were: \"Shout, Republicans, Shout! We've Cleaned the Breech Clouts Out!\" Dr. Foster was the editor of the Minnesotian and was quite a power in the Republican party. He wielded a vigorous pen and possessed a very irascible temper. I have often seen him perform some Horace Greeley antics in the composing room of the old Minnesotian. At the time of the execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, I remember bringing the Chicago Tribune to the doctor, containing the announcement of the execution. I had arranged the paper so that the doctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance. The doctor looked at the headlines a second and then exclaimed, loud enough to be heard a block, \"Great God! In the nineteenth century, a man hung for an idea!\" At another time the doctor became very much enraged over some news that I had laid before him. In the early 50's Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, introduced into the house of representatives the first homestead law and the Republican party soon afterward incorporated the idea into their platform as one of their pet measures. After superhuman effort the bill passed the house of representatives, that body being nearly tie politically, and was sent to the senate. The Democratic majority in the senate was not very favorably impressed with the measure, but with the assistance of the late President Johnson, who was senator from Tennessee at that time, the bill passed the senate by a small majority. There was great rejoicing over the event and no one supposed for a moment that the president would veto the measure. When I laid the Chicago Tribune before the excitable doctor containing the announcement of Buchanan's veto the very air was blue with oaths. The doctor took the paper and rushed out into the street waving the paper frantically in the air, cursing the president at every step. From 1854, the date of the starting of the three St. Paul daily papers, until 1860, the time of the completion of the Winslow telegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the street with the full text of the president's message. The messages of Pierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding their arrival the various offices had all the type of every description distributed and all the printers who could possibly be procured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming message.", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c49b770a2f437d2a1478f52b0f2747ef", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "the time of the completion of the Winslow telegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the street with the full text of the president's message. The messages of Pierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding their arrival the various offices had all the type of every description distributed and all the printers who could possibly be procured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming message. It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to the foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified to be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle. One year one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would surprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In the city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the mail coach, and expected to return to St. Paul three or four hours in advance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage over his competitors. Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the stage left Chicago the message was delivered in St. Paul twenty-four hours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian had the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the complete message, long before he returned to St. Paul. The management always provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first out with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos to fully recover from its effect. As an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at this time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that in the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and Sayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic national convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats were in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated for president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on the way from the boat landing to the office would be: \"Anything from the prize fight? What is the news from the Charleston convention?\" \"The good old times\" printers often talk about were evidently not the years between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the Civil war in 1861. Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to speak of. When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it would be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with a new Bank Note Reporter. Married men considered themselves very fortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a grocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single men seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash. That was not more than half enough to pay their board bill. This state of affairs continued until the Press was started in 1861, when Gov. Marshall inaugurated the custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every Saturday night. Another instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily paper of that day: During the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and politicians visited St. Paul, consisting of State Senator W.H. Seward. Senator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, Senator Nye, Gen. Stewart L. Woodford and several others of lesser celebrity. The party came to Minnesota in the interest of the Republican candidate for president. Mr. Seward made a great speech from the front steps of the old capitol, in which he predicted that at some distant day the capitol of this great republic would be located not far from the Falls of St. Anthony. There was a large gathering at the capitol to hear him, but those who were not fortunate enough to get within sound of his voice had to wait until the New York Herald, containing a full report of his speech, reached St. Paul before they could read what the great statesman had said. In the fall of 1860 the first telegraph line was completed to St. Paul. Newspaper proprietors thought they were then in the world, so far as news is concerned, but it was not to be so. The charges for telegraph news were so excessive that the three papers in St. Paul could not afford the luxury of the \"latest news by Associated Press.\" The offices combined against the extortionate rates demanded by the telegraph company and made an agreement not to take the dispatches until the rates were lowered; but it was like an agreement of the railroad presidents of the present day, it was not adhered to. The Pioneer made a secret contract with the telegraph company and left the Minnesotian and the Times out in the cold. Of course that was a very unpleasant state of affairs and for some time the Minnesotian and Times would wait until the Pioneer was out in the morning and would then set up the telegraph and circulate their papers. One of the editors connected with the Minnesotian had an old acquaintance in the pressroom of the Pioneer, and through him secured one of the first papers printed. This had been going on for some time when Earle S. Goodrich, the editor of the Pioneer, heard of it, and he accordingly made preparation to perpetrate a huge joke on the Minnesotian. Mr. Goodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five columns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies of the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian. The scheme worked to a charm. Amongst the bogus news was a two-column speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate just previous to the breaking out of the war.

Mr. Goodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five columns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies of the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian. The scheme worked to a charm. Amongst the bogus news was a two-column speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate just previous to the breaking out of the war. Mr. Seward's well-known ideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not questioned. The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting to be from the then excited Southern States. The Minnesotian received a Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition was distributed throughout the city. I had distributed the Minnesotian throughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to Bridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for being so late. He smiled, but did not speak. As soon as I learned what had happened I did not do either. The best of the joke was, the Times could not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus news from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to circulate when they heard of the sell. They at once set up the genuine news and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the Minnesotian for being so easily taken in. The Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was started, on the 1st of January, 1861. The Press made arrangements with Mr. Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another hitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain its telegraph from proof sheets of the St. Anthony Falls News, a paper published in what is now East Minneapolis. Gov. Marshall was very much exercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph news, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he had a very stormy interview with Mr. Winslow. No one ever knew exactly what he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic reports, and has had ever since. Gov. Marshall was a noble man. When the first battle of Bull Run occurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory. I remember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper as a young kitten. After the circus was out I went back to the office to see if any late news had been received. I met Gov. Marshall at the door, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the Union force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the country would never recover from it. But it did, and the governor was afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his country's honor. Printers were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for \"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that it was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a respectable appearance. The Press advertised for anything that could set type to come in and help it out. I remember one man applying who said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical knowledge of the business. One evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the late T.M. Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and told the foreman he thought he could help him out. He was given a piece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press. He was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems. Mr. Metcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the city over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press. The old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining until the paper was up. Although Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any other state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was necessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population was largely foreign. The feeling against the draft was very bitter, and the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did not take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they did not espouse. A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from the fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur. Arrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as possible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take place on the day designated by the war department. This situation of affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following characteristic reply was received: \"If the draft cannot take place, of course it cannot take place. Necessity knows no law. A. Lincoln.\" The bitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the old St. Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous prosecution of the war. Threats were made to mob the office. A company was organized for self-defense, and Capt. E.R. Otis, now of West Superior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post commander. Capt. Otis had seen service in the early part of the war and the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine military man for a leader.

The office was barricaded, fifteen old Springfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought down from the capitol and every one instructed what to do in case of an attack. I slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building overlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my bed. I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the employes had gone home. As there was no possible avenue of escape in case of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed poor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard. But there was no riot. The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place without interruption. Before and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage of all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following Christmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made arrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third and Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert. It happened that on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had occurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg. The Pioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra on that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself. The news of these two great events had become pretty generally known throughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was simply intense. The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not propose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had been received. A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press office, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories. I had helped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the press room. As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed I attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale. As I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the counting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had become so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that direction, and undertook to retreat and try another route. But quicker than a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and walked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what few papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out. As soon as the magnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air, and cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a noise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St. Paul had celebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history. I arrived in St. Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and Immediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo. W. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper. I had not been at work long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was. Congress had passed a bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no telegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three days for the news to reach the state. The Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening before. It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was brought to St. Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of the Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same on the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers. The Minnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers and they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise. It was not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining news and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter. I could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops 'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860. During the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to expand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of our rapidly increasing population. The various papers were printed on single-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were introduced. In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the city, printing four pages at one time. In 1880 the different offices introduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines were installed. The next great advance will probably be some system of photography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer and proofreader. Who knows? THE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION. EARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST ATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS. \"Right this way for the Fuller house!\" \"Right this way for the Winslow house!\" \"Right this way for the American house!\" \"Merchants hotel on the levee!\" \"Stage for St. Anthony Falls!\" These were the announcements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would alight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith, Dubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling by steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper Mississippi. Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house, the Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western house, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years attracted the attention of the visitor, and many others.

Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house, the Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western house, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years attracted the attention of the visitor, and many others. The Merchants is the only one left, and that only in name. Messengers from newspaper offices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants looking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and the ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims, were among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the arrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected. At one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily line to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St. Louis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river. Does any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the combination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the little Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the Denmark? The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and when any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as a major general of the regulars. It was no uncommon sight to see six or eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance presented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time. The first boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage, and as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an effort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible. Traveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant, but it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the winter. Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough goods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive to ship goods by express during the winter. Occasionally some enterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing through the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express a new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters. The stages on most of the routes left St. Paul at 4 o'clock in the morning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty miles of the city could read the news as early as they can during these wonderful days of steam and electricity. Probably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much interest as the one known as the \"Five Million Loan Election.\" It was not a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it; although the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it at a later period. The only paper of any prominence that opposed the passage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr. Thomas Foster. That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who favored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an opposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor. The great panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business of every description and it was contended that the passage of this measure would give employment to thousands of people; that the rumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the state, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be able to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a few dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by any ordinary methods of speculation. The campaign was short and the amendment carried by an immense majority. So nearly unanimous was the sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was extremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to it. The city of St. Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a majority of over 4,000 for the law. There was no Australian law at that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of molestation. One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in opposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O. Sweeney, now a resident of Duluth. It was lithographed and widely circulated. The newspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time. They had to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers. It was proposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to donate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every mile of road graded and ready to iron. Work Was commenced soon after the passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the railroad companies upon Gov. Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in accordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the state. Gov. Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of the state had been fully protected. The railroad companies would not accept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they obtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they be issued. The governor held that the supreme court had no authority to coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the advice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction between the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the mandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds. Judge Flandrau dissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas prevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly improved. Dr. Foster did not believe Gov.

Judge Flandrau dissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas prevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly improved. Dr. Foster did not believe Gov. Sibley was sincere in his efforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with the same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall. The doctor would never acknowledge that Gov. Sibley was the legal governor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign the bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the principal nor the interest would ever be paid. The Minnesotian carried at the head of its columns the words \"Official Paper of the City,\" and it was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials, denouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would be construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the people in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a bad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds. An effort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of its official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to abrogate its contract. Threats were made to throw the office into the river, but they did not materialize. When Gov. Sibley endeavored to place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted with conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and humiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt. The bonds could not be negotiated. The whole railway construction scheme suddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of the state was compromised, \"and enterprise of great pith and moment had turned their currents awry.\" The evil forbodings of the Minnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years the repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her otherwise spotless record. Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on which the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to new organizations. During the administration of Gov. Pillsbury the state compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per cent of their nominal value. Will she ever pay the rest? In the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee between the Sioux and the Chippewas. A party of Chippewa warriors, under the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a body of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly opened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty. Eight or ten Chippewas were killed during the engagement. The daily papers sent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that vicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements. Among the reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the Eastern cities. He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and furnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of the preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable to find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\" As the Sioux and Chippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded considerable amusement to the old inhabitants. The celebration in St. Paul in honor of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858, was one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations that ever occurred in the city. The announcement of the completion of the enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did not reach St. Paul until two or three days later, as there was no telegraphic communication to the city at that time. As soon as messages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President Buchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand celebration. Most of the cities throughout the United States were making preparations to celebrate on that day, and St. Paul did not propose to be outdone. The city council appropriated several hundred dollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination. An elaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit to the city at the present time marched through the principal streets, to the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and surrounding country. To show that a procession in the olden time was very similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of procession is appended: THE PROCESSION.   Escort of Light Cavalry.   Band.   Pioneer Guard.   City Guard.   City Battery.   Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,     representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,     the different States of the Union, and     other devices.   The Governor and State Officers in carriages.   The Judges of the State in carriages.   The Clergy.   Officers of the Army.   Officers of the Navy.   The Municipal Authorities of Neighboring Cities.   The Board of Education in Carriages.   The Mayor and City Council.   Knights Templars on Horseback.   Band.   Odd Fellows.   Druids.

Citizens on Horseback.   Brewers on Horseback.   Butchers on Horseback. Col. AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief, and he was assisted by a large number of aides. The Pioneer Guards, the oldest military company in the state, had the right of line. They had just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the drum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days, presented a very", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d26c30cc3102d9679f3880d6b7c95b61", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "riages.   Citizens on Horseback.   Brewers on Horseback.   Butchers on Horseback. Col. AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief, and he was assisted by a large number of aides. The Pioneer Guards, the oldest military company in the state, had the right of line. They had just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the drum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days, presented a very imposing appearance. The Pioneer Guards were followed by the City Guards, under Capt. John O'Gorman. A detachment of cavalry and the City Battery completed the military part of the affair. The fire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H. Williams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha Engine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was the next in order. One of the most attractive features of the occasion was the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company. In a large car drawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of printers and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several epochs in the life of the great philosopher. In the car with the representatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a beautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's theater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear. She represented the Goddess of Liberty. The car was ornamented with flowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions \"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\" The Pioneer book bindery was also represented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female, were employed in different branches of the business. These beautiful floats were artistically designed by George H. Colgrave, who is still in the service of the Pioneer Press company. One of the unique features of the parade, and one that attracted great attention, was a light brigade, consisting of a number of school children mounted, and they acted as a guard of honor to the president and queen. In an open barouche drawn by four horses were seated two juvenile representatives of President Buchanan and Queen Victoria. The representative of British royalty was Miss Rosa Larpenteur, daughter of A.L. Larpenteur, and the first child born of white parents in St. Paul. James Buchanan was represented by George Folsom, also a product of the city. Col. R.E.J. Miles and Miss Emily Dow, the stars at the People's theater, were in the line of march on two handsomely caparisoned horses, dressed in Continental costume, representing George and Martha Washington. The colonel looked like the veritable Father of His Country. There were a number of other floats, and nearly all the secret societies of the city were in line. The procession was nearly two miles in length and they marched three and one-half hours before reaching their destination. To show the difference between a line of march at that time and one at the present day, the following is given: THE LINE OF MARCH. Up St. Anthony street to Fort street, up Fort street to Ramsey street, then countermarch down Fort to Fourth street, down Fourth street to Minnesota street, up Minnesota street to Seventh street, down Seventh street to Jackson street, up Jackson street to Eighth street, down Eighth street to Broadway, down Broadway to Seventh street, up Seventh street to Jackson street, down Jackson street to Third street, up Third street to Market street. Ex-Gov. W.A. Gorman and ex-Gov. Alex. Ramsey were the orators of the occasion, and they delivered very lengthy addresses. It had been arranged to have extensive fireworks in the evening, but on account of the storm they had to be postponed until the following night. It was a strange coincidence that on the very day of the celebration the last message was exchanged between England and America. The cable had been in successful operation about four weeks and 129 messages were received from England and 271 sent from America. In 1866 a new company succeeded in laying the cable which is in successful operation to-day. Four attempts were made before the enterprise was successful--the first in 1857, the second in 1858, the third in 1863 and the successful one in 1865. Cyrus W. Field, the projector of the enterprise, received the unanimous thanks of congress, and would have been knighted by Great Britain had Mr. Field thought it proper to accept such honor. Some time during the early '50s a secret order known as the Sons of Malta was organized in one of the Eastern states, and its membership increased throughout the West with as much rapidity as the Vandals and Goths increased their numbers during the declining years of the Roman Empire. Two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a charter from Pittesburg in 1858 and instituted a lodge in St. Paul. It was a grand success from the start. Merchants, lawyers, doctors, printers, and in fact half of the male population, was soon enrolled in the membership of the order. There was something so grand, gloomy and peculiar about the initiation that made it certain that as soon as one victim had run the gauntlet he would not be satisfied until another one had been procured. When a candidate had been proposed for membership the whole lodge acted as a committee of investigation, and if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his dealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when being examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the order--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from the manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had been removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that his confession had been made to the full", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-009fdf8cbf7983837bf283e7b7bb7b52", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "of investigation, and if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his dealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when being examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the order--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from the manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had been removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that his confession had been made to the full membership of the order. Occasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a transgresser than his questioners had anticipated. The following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for admission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of the acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand Commander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake nights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand Commander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an immense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the candidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come. The scheme of bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular during the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been original with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the many atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order. Some time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the order from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St. Paul. Among the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett of Cincinnati, and Gov. Alexander Randall of Wisconsin. They arrived at the lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall of the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them. The visitors were arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads, and looked more like the prisoners in the play of \"Lucretia Borgia\" than members of modern civilization. On the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha Falls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole. This organization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour one of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev. John Penman to consent to become one of its members. Mr. Penman was so highly Indignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the initiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work, with numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper's Weekly. The exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines, and ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented a dark and gloomy appearance. The reverend gentleman was judge of probate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly diminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his advantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere. The Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never cherished much love for each other. The ravings of the Eatanswill Gazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little papers in describing the shortcomings of their \"vile and reptile contemporary.\" After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known that the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the managers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively campaign for the office of state printer. Both papers had worked hard for the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims on the party for recognition. Both offices were badly in need of financial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful one of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend. How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the problem that confronted the legislature about to assemble. The war of words between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity. The editor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times as \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson\"--his right name being Thomas M. Newson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr. Foster as the \"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian.\" To effect a reconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic talent of the party leaders. After frequent consultations between the leading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was arranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the paper should be the Minnesotian and Times. It can readily be seen that a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was not likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity. The relations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one management than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate. This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature adjourned, when the partnership was dissolved. Dr. Foster assumed entire control of the Minnesotian and Maj. Newson was manager of the Times. George W. Moore was associated with Dr. Foster in the publication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when the offices separated it was stipulated that Mr. Moore should have the printing of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part payment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson, Moore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the paper he helped to found. After the arrangement was made it was with the greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville Brown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state printer and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that village. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-2a3ab772f4c7d1211b5007a6c92e23da", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "with the paper he helped to found. After the arrangement was made it was with the greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville Brown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state printer and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that village. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with its material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the Minnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender to its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire plant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr. Foster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in the volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W. Moore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Does any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North Star? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever have chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During the presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the Douglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There were only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of Mr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson Independent--and as they had been designated by the president to publish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary to print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the administration colors at the head of their columns. They were called \"bread and butter papers.\" The supporters of Mr. Breckinridge thought their cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an organ at the capital of the state. Accordingly the late H.H. Young, the editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that village and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance. It was not necessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a perfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily newspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six cases of type were all that were necessary. This paper was published regularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the officeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it soon collapsed. St. Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper history. It was called the St. Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by Dr. Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to Gov. Sam Medary. This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its violent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with much favor, and only existed about eight months. Some time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about half a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt. They could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one. Occasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the better of him and he would uncork a bottle. The experiment was never repeated. Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested in a printing office for more than two years. During the campaign of 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed political organizations intended to attract the attention of voters. One dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an active member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge Square as they were returning to their hall after a long march. In order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two organisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian office in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this nauseating beverage. It was a golden opportunity. The invitation was readily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the advocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black Republican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky. Bottle after bottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats of these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much gusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation that produced his twenty years' sleep. One of the cardinal principles of the Democracy, at that time was to \"love rum and hate <DW65>s.\" As the entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of march, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of their platform was rigidly adhered to. THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862. NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH COULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL. In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations calling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of reinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern rebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond; the army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe reverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not been able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy; rebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in Kentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f2440d11a9db0e7c5ec428e134dc47e0", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond; the army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe reverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not been able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy; rebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in Kentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant watch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which they readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid in the prosecution of their cause. France was preparing to invade Mexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment of a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister republic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save Russia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to the success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention in behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the government in the North were especially active in their efforts to prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president; conspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by government detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring to spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North. It was during this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression of the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the history of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of Minnesota. It can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope with an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be. By the terms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the Sioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide on each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big Stone lake. In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river was sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow. The selling of this strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little Crow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction. The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the south side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor. There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits of civilization and worked like white men. This was very distasteful to many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before the treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game and sell fur to traders. The government built houses for those who desired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them how to farm. At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak they had several hundred acres of land under cultivation. The disinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced dissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the white man's party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and the Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who believed it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform manual labor. The white man's, or farmer's party, was favored by the government, some of them having fine houses built for them. The other Indians did not like this, and became envious of them because they discontinued the customs of the tribe. There was even said to have been a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was to declare war upon the whites. The Indians also claimed that they were not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely entirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they were ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the paymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and often leaving many of them in debt. They protested against permitting the traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and deduct from their small annuities the amount due them. They had at least one white man's idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they got ready. For several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the agencies to get their money. Day after day and week after week passed and there was no sign of paymasters. The year 1862 was the the second year of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been taxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war, it looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota. Many of the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money and their families were suffering. The Indians were told that on account of the great war in which the government was engaged the payment would never be made. Their annuities were payable in gold and they were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with. Maj. Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go South, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to believe that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and get their land back. It was believed that the men who had enlisted last had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they could clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and Chippewas would come to their assistance. It is known that the Sioux had been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief, but the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an understanding. It was even said at the time that the Confederate government had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report and no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness. Under the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called upon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and T", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c5b84432ad1a7600b31aab3ee4243129", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "that the Sioux had been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief, but the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an understanding. It was even said at the time that the Confederate government had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report and no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness. Under the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called upon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men mustered in when the news reached St. Paul that open hostilities had commenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the whites was taking place. The people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that they were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their indignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these treacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers of the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had, without a moment's warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of men, women and children. It was a singular fact that farmer Indians, whom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard to civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after hostilities had actually commenced. A few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency a portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county. There they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood. It was the first step in the great massacre that soon followed. On the morning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an indiscriminate massacre was inaugurated. A detachment of Company B of the Fifth regiment, under command of Capt. Marsh, went to the scene of the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their number, including the captain, killed. The horrible work of murder, pillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux reservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions of the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors. The Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and Seminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when compared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this terrible outbreak. In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed, several million dollars' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people rendered homeless. The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern boundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota river, had been in a twinkling depopulated. How to repel these invaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the state as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied, was the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national authorities. Shortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received, word was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were assuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and Chippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been influenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an indiscriminate massacre of the whites. Indian Agent Walker undertook to arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had scented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which caused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and they were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable tribes. The suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the extraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless settlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every side, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session of the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip volunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of shelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky warriors. Could anything be more terrible than Gov. Ramsey's picture of the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature? \"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages could wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from the category of their crimes,\" said the governor. \"Helplessness and innocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs, seemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage. Infants hewn into bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the murdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her pulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful tragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by these brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into captivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families burned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself with outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating the bodies of the dead.

Other Day was an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days, but experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak and had adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St. Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver, and in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll hall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of home guards, he said: \"I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the midst of evil. I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing. I have been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write. This I found to be good. I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and thus learned my vileness. At the present time I have fallen into great evil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men, women and children, without moccasins, without food and without a blanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my heart is glad. I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit.\" Other Day had been a member of the church for several years and his religion taught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct. It was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest. Ex-Gov. Sibley, on account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed in command of the troops ordered to assemble at St. Peter, and in a few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming, half-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition, commenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins. The newspapers and the people were crying \"On to Ridgely!\" which was then beleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl \"On to Richmond!\" previous to the disaster at Bull Run. Any one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of \"The Girl I Left Behind Me\" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the little garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the forces under command of Gen. Sibley. Fort Ridgely was a fort only in name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden buildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection when attacked by a large force. The garrison was under the command of Lieut. T.J. Sheehan. His force consisted of about 150 men from the Fifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of civilians. He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and equipped. Although there were only two attempts made to capture the garrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days. In addition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support and protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long expected, arrived there the day before the outbreak. After bravely defending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was relieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command of Col. McPhail, being the advance of Gen. Sibley's command. During the siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and spherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with busy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces and used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror among the redskins. Almost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in large numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident intention of burning and pillaging the village. Judge Charles E. Flandrau of this city, who was then residing at St. Peter, organized a company of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of that place. The judge received several acquisitions to his force while en route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of about 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience. They arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in driving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several citizens having been killed and a number of houses burned. Two or three days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded the town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts. After a desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge Flandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired. There were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or 1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had the Indian attack been successful. Provisions and ammunition becoming scarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the country to Mankato. They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded them with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the fight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested. Nearly two hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving nothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed barricade. The long procession of families leaving their desolated homes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes in the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the gallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a place of safety. As soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A of the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul, and seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt. Jo Anderson,", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-49dd4de896cb4d1aa7c0c3db3861fcd1", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "to return, formed one of the saddest scenes in the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the gallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a place of safety. As soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A of the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul, and seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt. Jo Anderson, also of St. Paul, and several citizen volunteers, all under the command of Maj. Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with instructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could be found, from their perilous surroundings. They were St. Paul organizations and most all of their members were St. Paul boys. They never had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not familiar with the use of firearms. After marching for two days, during which time they interred a large number of victims of the savage Sioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from Fort Ridgely. The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of timber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet on the other. It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the command to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been known that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors. Maj. Brown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command. About 4 o'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or 600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate fire upon the almost helpless little command. For two days they bravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was found that about half their number had been killed or wounded. When the news of the disaster reached St. Paul there was great excitement. Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in their denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were responsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens. It was feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the savages. Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view of the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers. There was no telegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick and fast. Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh outrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover from the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be received. Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were arriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their houses to be destroyed. The situation was appalling, and many of our citizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail to check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin. Every boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees, and the people of St. Paul were often called upon to assist in forwarding them to their place of destination. Home guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened portion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms or ammunition and their services would have been of little account against the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked. Advertisements appeared in the St. Paul newspapers offering rewards of $25 a piece for Sioux scalps. Gov. Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and published in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents of the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of the Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley, 150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine county, 210 miles distant. This may have been gratifying to the residents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the frontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were seeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia. About 12 o'clock one night during the latter part of August a report was circulated over the northern and western portion of St. Paul that the savages were near the city, and many women and children were aroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the protection of the city authorities. It was an exciting but rather amusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the frontier. Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was not until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St. Paul felt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux. As soon as Gen. Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable him to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations. He had collected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including the Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of Capt. Mark Hendricks. The expedition marched for two or three days without encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of September several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment were fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake. About 800 of the command were engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal number of Indians. After a spirited engagement Col. Marshall, with about 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded in utterly routing them. Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty wounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with the whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After the battle Gen.

Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty wounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with the whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After the battle Gen. Pope, who was in command of the department of the Northwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was over and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his command. This request of Gen. Pope was met with a decided remonstrance by the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the removal of any of the troops until they had made two long marches through the Dakotas and to Montana. Gen. Sibley's command reached Camp Release on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was located a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the massacres. They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods and white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to precede at once to their rescue. Gen. Sibley was of the opinion that any hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the prisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution. After a few preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the captives were released. As soon as possible Gen. Sibley made inquiries as to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes recently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of them had been guilty of the grossest atrocities. The general decided to form a military tribunal and try the offenders. After a series of sittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November, 321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of whom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms of imprisonment according to their crimes. All of the condemned prisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail constructed for the purpose. After the court-martial had completed its work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities, a great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale slaughter of the beloved red man. The Quakers of Philadelphia and the good people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president to put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution. The president, after consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the execution of only thirty-eight of the most flagrant cases, and accordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862. Previous to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed by Rev. S.R. Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions. Nearly every one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to them. Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and when speaking of their wives and children almost every one was affected to tears. Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of salvation, and expected to go at once to the abode of the Great Spirit. Rattling Runner, who was a son-in-law of Wabasha, dictated the following letter, which is a sample of the confessions made to Dr. Riggs: \"Wabasha, you have deceived me. You told me if we followed the advice of Gen. Sibley and gave ourselves up, all would be well--no innocent man would be injured. I have not killed or injured a white man or any white person. I have not participated in the plunder of their property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution and must die, while men who are guilty will remain in prison. My wife is your daughter, my children are your grandchildren. I leave them all in your care and under your protection. Do not let them suffer, and when they are grown up let them know that their father died because he followed the advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man to answer for to the Holy Spirit. My wife and children are dear to me. Let them not grieve for me; let them remember that the brave should be prepared to meet death, and I will do as becomes a Dakotah.\" Wabasha was a Sioux chief, and although he was not found guilty of participating in any of the massacres of women and children, he was probably in all the most important battles. Wabasha county, and Wabasha street in St. Paul were named after his father. After the execution the bodies were taken down, loaded into wagons and carried down to a sandbar in front of the city, where they were all dumped into the same hole. They did not remain there long, but were spirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a dissecting knife. Little Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the number that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a farmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson. His scalp is now in the state historical society. Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a few miles below St. Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian. Little Crow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish that his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom himself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the old man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute, quarrelsome and dangerous Indian. He was opposed to all change of dress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and teachers. He was seldom known to tell the truth and possessed very few redeeming qualities. Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians, he was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent assumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless struggle against the whites. Between the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there was great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the president should pardon the", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-68a152136647fcdc06015572bf449dc8", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "was opposed to all change of dress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and teachers.

Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians, he was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent assumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless struggle against the whites. Between the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there was great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the president should pardon the condemned. Meetings were held throughout the valley and organizations were springing into existence for the purpose of overpowering the strong guard at Mankato and wreaking summary justice upon the Indians. The situation became so serious pending the decision of the president that the governor was compelled to issue a proclamation calling upon all good citizens not to tarnish the fair name of the state by an act of lawlessness that the outside world would never forget, however great was the provocation. When the final order came to execute only thirty-eight there was great disappointment. Petitions were circulated in St. Paul and generally signed favoring the removal of the condemned Indians to Massachusetts to place them under the refining influence of the constituents of Senator Hoar, the same people who are now so terribly shocked because a humane government is endeavoring to prevent, in the Philippines, a repetition of the terrible atrocities committed in Minnesota. The balance of the condemned were kept in close confinement till spring, when they were taken to Davenport, and afterward to some point on the Missouri river, where a beneficent government kindly permitted them to sow the seed of discontent that finally culminated in the Custer massacre. When it was known that the balance of the condemned Indians were to be transported to Davenport by steamer. St. Paul people made preparations to give them a warm reception as they passed down the river, but their intentions were frustrated by the government officers in charge of their removal, as they arranged to have the steamer Favorite, on which they were to be transported, pass by the city in the middle of the night. St. Paul people were highly indignant when apprised of their escape. Little Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the outbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at Pembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling, where they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of 10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital punishment for their great crimes. Little Six confessed to having murdered fifty white men, women and children. One of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to contend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the frontier. There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to transport provisions was by wagon. An order was issued by the military authorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose, but the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient alacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it was necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly impressing into service of the government any and all teams that could be found on the streets or in stables. A detachment of Company K of the Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the city several days on that especial duty. As soon as the farmers heard that the government was taking possession of everything that came over the bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried it to Hastings. There was one silver-haired farmer living near the city limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with the South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could not locate his team. One of the members of Company K was a former neighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty to see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government. A close watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down to the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where he thought they would be safe until he returned. As soon as the old man passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses, and when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden with supplies for the troops at the fort. Of course the government subsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in this particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it. Gov. Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the military squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in charge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it exempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that a power higher than the governor required that team and that it must go to Abercrombie. And it did. It was necessary to send out a large escort with these supply trains and It was easier to procure men for that purpose than it was for the regular term of enlistment. On one of the trains that left St. Paul was a young man by the name of Hines. He was as brave as Julius Caesar. He said so himself. He was so heavily loaded with various weapons of destruction that his companions called him a walking arsenal. If Little Crow had attacked this particular train the Indian war would have ended. This young man had been so very demonstrative of his ability to cope with the entire Sioux force that his companions resolved to test his bravery. One night when the train was camped about half way between St. Cloud and Sauk Center, several of the guards attached to the train painted their faces, arrayed themselves in Indian costume and charged through the camp, yelling the Indian war hoop and firing guns in every direction.

Young Hines was the first to hear the alarm, and didn't stop running until he reached St. Cloud, spreading the news in every direction that the entire tribe of Little Crow was only a short distance behind. Of course there was consternation along the line of this young man's masterly retreat, and it was some time before the panic-stricken citizens knew what had actually happened. In response to the appeal of Gov. Sibley and other officers on the frontier, the ladies of St. Paul early organized for the purpose of furnishing sick and wounded soldiers with such supplies as were not obtainable through the regular channels of the then crude condition of the various hospitals. Notices like the following often appeared in the daily papers at that time: \"Ladies Aid Society--A meeting of the ladies' aid society for the purpose of sewing for the relief of the wounded soldiers at our forts, and also for the assistance of the destitute refugees now thronging our city, is called to meet this morning at Ingersoll hall. All ladies interested in this object are earnestly invited to attend. All contributions of either money or clothing will be thankfully received. By order of the president, \"Mrs. Stella Selby. \"Miss M.O. Holyoke, Secretary.\" Mrs. Selby was the wife of John W. Selby, one of the first residents of the city, Miss Holyoke was the Clara Barton of Minnesota, devoting her whole time and energy to the work of collecting sanitary supplies for the needy soldiers in the hospitals. Scores of poor soldiers who were languishing in hospital tents on the sunburnt and treeless prairies of the Dakotas, or suffering from disease contracted in the miasmatic swamps of the rebellious South have had their hearts gladdened and their bodies strengthened by being supplied with the delicacies collected through the efforts of the noble and patriotic ladies of this and kindred organizations throughout the state. Many instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the field and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the imperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic wives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened crops. By reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in addition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the lands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about 750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000. Had they behaved themselves and remained In possession of this immense tract of land, they would have been worth twice as much per capita as any community in the United States. FIREMEN AND FIRES OF PIONEER DAYS. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ST. PAUL, FIRE DEPARTMENT--PIONEER HOOK AND LADDER COMPANY--HOPE ENGINE COMPANY AND MINNEHAHA ENGINE COMPANY--A LARGE NUMBER OF HOTEL FIRES. WHEN WE RAN WITH THE OLD MACHINE.   Brave relics of the past are we,     Old firemen, staunch and true,   We're thinking now of days gone by     And all that we've gone through.   Thro' fire and flames we've made our way,     And danger we have seen;   We never can forget the time     When we ran with the old machine.   In numbers now we are but few,   A host have pased away,   But still we're happy, light and free,     Our spirits never decay   We often sigh for those old days     Whose memory we keep green,   Oh! there was joy for man and boy,     When we ran with the old machine.                          --Gus Wiliams. Instruments for extinguishing fires were introduced in various parts of Europe more than three hundred years ago. The fire laddies of that period would probably look aghast if they could see the implements in use at the present time. One of the old time machines is said to consist of a huge tank of water placed upon wheels, drawn by a large number of men, and to which was attached a small hose. When the water in the tank became exhausted it was supplied by a bucket brigade, something on the plan in use at the present time in villages not able to support an engine. The oldest record of a fire engine in Paris was one used in the king's library in 1684, which, having but one cylinder, threw water to a great height, a result obtained by the use of an air chamber. Leather hose was introduced into Amsterdam in 1670, by two Dutchmen, and they also invented the suction pipe at about the same period. About the close of the seventeenth century an improved engine was patented in England. It was a strong cistern of oak placed upon wheels, furnished with a pump, an air chamber and a suction pipe of strong leather, through which run a spiral piece of metal. This engine was little improved until the early part of the last century. In the United States bucket fire departments were organized in most of the cities in the early part of the last century, and hand engines, used by the old volunteer firemen, did not come into general use until about fifty years later. The New York volunteer fire department was for a long time one of the institutions of the country. When they had their annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock to the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day when a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed on exhibition.

The New York volunteer fire department was for a long time one of the institutions of the country. When they had their annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock to the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day when a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed on exhibition. At the New York state fairs during the early '50s the tournaments of the volunteer fire department of the various cities throughout the state formed one of the principal attractions. Many a melee occurred between the different organizations because they considered that they had not been properly recognized in the line of march or had not been awarded a medal for throwing a stream of water farther than other competitors. A Berlin correspondent of the Pioneer Press many years ago, said that when an alarm of fire was sounded in the city, the members of the fire companies would put on their uniforms and report to their various engine houses. When a sufficient number had assembled to make a showing the foreman would call the roll, beer would be passed down the line, the health of the kaiser properly remembered and then they would start out in search of the fire. As a general thing the fire would be out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then return to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed. To Cincinnati belongs the credit of having introduced the first paid steam fire department in the United States, but all the other large cities rapidly followed. In the fall of 1850 the town fathers of St. Paul passed an ordinance requiring the owners of all buildings, public or private, to provide and keep in good repair, substantial buckets, marked with paint the word \"Fire\" on one side and the owner's name on the other, subject to inspection by the fire warden and to be under his control when occasion required. The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade, was made by R.C. Knox in the fall of 1851. Mr. Knox raised a small sum of money by subscription, with which he purchased several ladders, and they were frequently brought into requisition by the little band of men whom Mr. Knox had associated with him. Mr. Knox was a man of enormous stature, and it was said he could tire out a dozen ordinary men at a fire. Two public-spirited citizens of St. Paul, John McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, purchased in the East and brought to the city at their own expense the first fire engine introduced in the Northwest. Although it was a miniature affair, on numerous occasions it rendered valuable assistance in protecting the property of our pioneer merchants. Mr. Ritchie is still living, his home being in Philadelphia. In November, 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized under provisions of the city charter. A constitution and by-laws were adopted and the members agreed to turn out promptly on all occasions of fire alarms. As compensation for their services they were excused from jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military service, for the period of five years. The original constitution of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership roll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B. Pearson and George F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason; members, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward Heenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash. M. Stees, J.W. Stevenson, Benjamin F. Irvine, R.I. Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A. Ward, Charles J. Williams. Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the city at the present time. Mr. McCloud was a member of the firm of McCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on the southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets. This was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as Mr. McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly be called the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\" The old hook and ladder company was one of the representative institutions of the city. From the date of its organization up to the time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members. All of the property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856, having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of the city fathers. At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and ladders, and one fire engine with hose. Washington M. Stees was made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant. This scanty equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water could be readily obtained. The city fathers concluded to comply with the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August, 1858. They were soon tested and pronounced satisfactory.

One of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder company in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name of A.D. Martin. He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he usually went by the name of \"Johnny Martin.\" Now Johnny always kept his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell sounded he was \"Johnny on the spot.\" After the fire was over Johnny generally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would make a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman before he returned to work. He would accordingly provide himself with an immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he proposed to execute his sanguinary threat. Strange to relate he never succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it generally required two or three days to restore him to his former equilibrium. If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he would probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen would not be so difficult. In 1857 Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned the common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use. In the fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new engines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their headquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of Franklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new brick building on Third street, fronting on Washington. Michael Leroy was made the first foreman and R.C. Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were his assistants. The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge, Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T. Toal, J.H. Barstow, J.C. Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes, B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F. Masterson, John J. Williams and V. Metzger. During the fall of 1858 a large number of the most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival of the first steamer. In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine. Company No. 2 was organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner of Third and Jackson streets. The first officers were H.P. Grant, foreman; M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger, assistants; members, Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A. Cariveau, H.A. Schlick. C.D. Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R. Storing, William T. Donaldson, Daniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace, John McCauley and a number of others. The Minnehahas were a prosperous organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its members as had nothing particular to do. Rotary Independent Company No. 1 was the third engine connected with the St. Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the annual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located on lower Third street. By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from that time on the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department was one of the events of the year. The first parade occurred on the 12th of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following organizations:   Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.   Hope Engine Company No. 1.   Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2.   Rotary Independent Company No. 1. These four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line of march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the old city hall. In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever there was an alarm of fire. The uptown churches would ring their bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches in the central part of the city would ring their bells. There was a regular banging and clanging of the bells.   \"In the startled air of night,   They would scream out their afright,   Too much horrified to speak,   They could only shriek, shriek,   Out of tune.\" Every one turned out when the fire bells rang. Unless the fire was of sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact location of the fire could be determined. Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to relieve them for a short time. As a general thing the appeal would be readily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the police to impress into service a force sufficient to keep the brakes working. Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to arrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse whenever the police were in search of a relief force.

Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to arrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse whenever the police were in search of a relief force. Upon the breaking out of the war a large number of the firemen enlisted in the defense of the country and the ranks of the department were sadly decimated. It was during the early part of the war that the mayor of St. Paul made a speech to the firemen at the close of their annual parade in which he referred to them as being as brave if not braver than the boys at the front. The friends of the boys in blue took serious umbrage at this break of the mayor, and the press of the city and throughout the state were very indignant to think that the capital city possessed a mayor of doubtful loyalty. The excitement soon died away and the mayor was re-elected by a large majority. There was not much change in the condition of the department until the arrival of the first steamer, Aug. 11, 1866. The new steamer was lodged with Hope Engine company, and an engineer and fireman appointed at a salary of $1,600 per year for the two. The boys of Hope Engine company did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer and took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded and St. Paul Hose Company No. 1 was organized, and they took charge of the new steamer. The rapid growth of the city necessitated the frequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and at the present time the St. Paul fire department has 211 paid men, 15 steamers, 4 chemicals, 8 hook and ladder companies and 122 horses. The volunteer fire department had no better friend than the late Mrs. Bartlett Presley. She was the guardian angel of the fire department. No night so cold or storm so great that Mrs. Presley was not present and with her own hands provide coffee and sandwiches for the tired and hungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames. She was an honored guest at all entertainments with which the firemen were connected, and was always toasted and feasted by the boys at the brakes. She will ever be remembered, not only by the firemen, but by all old settlers, as one of the many noble women in St. Paul whose unostentatious deeds of charity have caused a ray of sunshine in many sad homes. Mrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire department, but by every resident of the city. Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than the Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in exigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced operations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a jury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be down.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted, but his apartments were soon incinerated.

The first hotel fire of any importance was that of the Daniels house, located on Eagle street near Seven Corners, which occurred in 1852. The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture.

Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature was held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for several terms. The Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on Robert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery element. These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time of their destruction. On the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever occurred in St. Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third street near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on hand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach. Nearly all the buildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were two-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses occupied by the owners of the stores. When the fire was at its height it was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before the flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the firemen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had the immense smouldering mass under control. Thirty-four buildings, the largest number ever destroyed in St. Paul, were in ashes. Of the two blocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and the other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L. Larpenteur. The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the first hotels built in St. Paul was among the ruins. The New England was a feature in St. Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov. and Mrs. Ramsey had begun housekeeping in 1849. The Empire saloon was another historic ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first Pioneer, April 10, 1849. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also destroyed at this fire. In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was entirely destroyed by fire. A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene. A few pieces of furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular hotel. The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city. The hotel was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M. Winslow. Mr. Winslow was one of the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West. In some peculiar manner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building without any capital, but when the building was completed he not only had the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a financier as well as a builder. The proprietors of the Winslow were arrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were discharged. The American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was one of the landmarks of the city for a good many years. It was built in 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel as their headquarters. Although it was of very peculiar architecture, the interior fittings were of a modern character. On a stormy night in the month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this hotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire was beyond their control. The weather was bitter cold, and the water would be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose. Finding their efforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their attention to saving the guests. There were some very narrow escapes, but no accidents of a very serious nature. As usual, thieves were present and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and wearing apparel belonging to the guests. In the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story brick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets. It was occupied by them as a banking house for a long time. The business center having been moved further down the street, they were compelled to seek quarters on Bridge Square. After the bank moved out of this building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them remodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about $20,000. It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized. When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom lost all they possessed.

After the bank moved out of this building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them remodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about $20,000. It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized. When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom lost all they possessed. The Linden theatrical company, which was playing at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers. At this fire a large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street were destroyed. When the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were left standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city authorities, had not been demolished. Dr. Schell, one of the best known physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near the hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their lax enforcement of the law. One night at 10 o'clock the city was visited by a terrific windstorm, and suddenly a loud crash was heard in the vicinity of the doctor's office. A portion of the walls of the hotel had fallen and the little building occupied by the doctor had been crushed in. The fire alarm was turned on and the fire laddies were soon on the spot. No one supposed the doctor was alive, but after the firemen had been at work a short time they could hear the voice of the doctor from underneath the rubbish. In very vigorous English, which the doctor knew so well how to use, he roundly upbraided the fire department for not being more expeditious in extricating him from his perilous position. After the doctor had been taken out of the ruins It was found that he had not been seriously injured, and in the course of a few weeks was able to resume practice. During the winter of 1868 the Emmert house, situated on Bench street near Wabasha, was destroyed by fire. The Emmert house was built in territorial times by Fred Emmert, who for some time kept a hotel and boarding house at that place. It had not been used for hotel purposes for some time, but was occupied by a  family and used as a boarding-house for <DW52> people. While the flames were rapidly consuming the old building the discovery was made that a man and his wife were sick in one of the rooms with smallpox. The crowd of onlookers fled in terror, and they would have been burned alive had not two courageous firemen carried them out of the building. It was an unusually cold night and the <DW52> people were dumped into the middle of the street and there allowed to remain. They were provided with clothing and some of the more venturesome even built a fire for them, but no one would volunteer to take them to a place of shelter. About 10 o'clock on the following day the late W.L. Wilson learned of the unfortunate situation of the two <DW52> people, and he immediately procured a vehicle and took them to a place of safety, and also saw that they were thereafter properly cared for. On the site of the old postoffice on the corner of Wabasha and Fifth streets stood the Mansion house, a three-story frame building erected by Nicholas Pottgieser in early days at an expense of $12,000. It was a very popular resort and for many years the weary traveler there received a hearty welcome. A very exciting event occurred at this house during the summer of 1866. A man by the name of Hawkes, a guest at the hotel, accidentally shot and instantly killed his young and beautiful wife. He was arrested and tried for murder, but after a long and sensational trial was acquited. The greatest hotel fire in the history of St. Paul occurred on the night of Feb. 3, 1869. The International hotel (formerly the Fuller house) was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson streets, and was erected by A.G. Fuller in 1856. It was built of brick and was five stories high. It cost when completed, about $110,000. For years it had been the best hotel in the West. William H. Seward and the distinguished party that accompanied him made this hotel their headquarters during their famous trip to the West in 1860. Gen. Pope and Gen. Sibley had their headquarters in this building, and from here emanated all the orders relating to the war against the rebellious Sioux. In 1861 the property came into the possession of Samuel Mayall, and he changed the name of it from Fuller house to International hotel. Col. E.C. Belote, who had formerly been the landlord of the Merchants, was the manager of the hotel. The fire broke out in the basement, it was supposed from a lamp in the laundry. The night was intensely cold, a strong gale blowing from the northwest. Not a soul could be seen upon the street. Within this great structure more than two hundred guests were wrapped in silent slumber. To rescue them from their perilous position was the problem that required instant action on the part of the firemen and the hotel authorities. The legislature was then in session, and many of the members were among the guests who crowded the hotel. A porter was the first to notice the blaze, and he threw a pail water upon it, but with the result that it made no impression upon the flames.

The fire continued to extend, and the smoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them completely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility. In the meantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the guests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their night Clothes. The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a crowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find their way to the street. The servant girls succeeded in getting out first, and made their way to the snow-covered streets without sufficient clothing to protect their persons, and most of them were without shoes. While the people were escaping from the building the fire was making furious and rapid progress. From the laundry the smoke issued into every portion of the building. There was no nook or corner that the flames did not penetrate. The interior of the building burned with great rapidity until the fire had eaten out the eastern and southern rooms, when the walls began to give indications of falling. The upper portion of them waved back and forth in response to a strong wind, which filled the night air with cinders. At last different portions of the walls fell, thus giving the flames an opportunity to sweep from the lower portions of the building. Great gusts, which seemed to almost lift the upper floors, swept through the broken walls. High up over the building the flames climbed, carrying with them sparks and cinders, and in come instances large pieces of timber. All that saved the lower part of the city from fiery destruction was the fact that a solid bed of snow a foot deep lay upon the roofs of all the buildings. During all this time there was comparative quiet, notwithstanding the fact that the fire gradually extended across Jackson street and also across Seventh street. Besides the hotel, six or eight other buildings were also on fire, four of which were destroyed. Women and men were to be seen hurrying out of the burning buildings in their night clothes, furniture was thrown into the street, costly pianos, richly upholstered furniture, valuable pictures and a great many other expensive articles were dropped in the snow in a helter-skelter manner. Although nearly every room in the hotel was occupied and rumors flew thick and fast that many of the guests were still in their rooms, fortunately no lives were lost and no one was injured. The coolest person in the building was a young man by the name of Pete O'Brien, the night watchman. When he heard of the fire he comprehended in a moment the danger of a panic among over two hundred people who were locked in sleep, unconscious of danger. He went from room to room and from floor to floor, telling them of the danger, but assuring them all that they had plenty of time to escape. He apparently took command of the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of battle. To his presence of mind and coolness many of the guests were indebted for their escape from a frightful death. The fire department worked hard and did good service. The city had no waterworks at that time, but relied for water entirely upon cisterns located in different parts of the city. When the cisterns became dry it was necessary to place the steamer at the river and pump water through over two thousand feet of hose. Among the guests at the hotel at the time of the fire were Gen. C.C. Andrews, Judge Lochren, Capt. H.A. Castle, Gen. W.G. Le Duc, Selah Chamberlain, Gov. Armstrong and wife, Charles A. Gilman and wife, Dr. W.W. Mayo, I.W. Webb, Dr. Charles N. Hewitt, M.H. Dunnell, Judge Thomas Wilson and more than two hundred others. The Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St. Peter street, was at one time one of of the swell hotels of the city. It was a frame building, four stories high and nicely situated. The proprietors of it intended it should be a family hotel, but it did not meet with the success anticipated, and when, on the 19th of May, 1878, it was burned to the ground it was unoccupied. The fire was thought to be the work of incendiaries. The loss was about $20,000, partially insured. Four firemen were quite seriously injured at this fire, but all recovered. The Carpenter house, on the corner of Summit avenue and Ramsey street, was built by Warren Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter was a man of colossal ideas, and from the picturesque location of his hotel, overlooking the city, he could see millions of tourists flocking to his hostelry. The panic of 1857, soon followed by the great Civil war, put a quietus on immigration, and left him stranded high on the beach. Mr. Carpenter's dream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th of January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some time previous passed beyond his control. At one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street. The average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever existed. The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota streets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city, and it was one of the last to be burned. The first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a thriving business. As the city grew it was made over into a large boarding house, and before the war Mrs. Corbett was manager of the place. It was afterward kept by Mrs. Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben Ferris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by fire.

The first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a thriving business. As the city grew it was made over into a large boarding house, and before the war Mrs. Corbett was manager of the place. It was afterward kept by Mrs. Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben Ferris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by fire. The building was burned In August, 1873. A hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house, situated on the corner of Fifth and St. Peter streets, the site of the Windsor hotel. It was a three-story frame structure and was built in the early seventies. Mr. Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and then sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was burned. The Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and that only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make room for the present building many years ago. Aside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that ever occurred at a fire in St. Paul took place in May, 1870, when the old Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed. Concert Hall was built by the late J.W. McClung in 1857, and the hall in the basement was one of the largest in the city. The building was three stories high in front and six or seven on the river side. It was located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk. Under the sidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from here that the fire was first noticed. In an incredibly short time flames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost impossible. On the river side of the building on the top floor two brothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop. The fire spread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames before they even thought their lives were endangered. In front of them was a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the river side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost certain death. They could be plainly seen frantically calling for help. There was no possible way to reach them. Finally Charles Mueller jumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant later he was followed by his brother. The bewildered spectators did not suppose for a moment that either could live. They were too much horrified to speak, but when it was over and they were lifted into beds provided for them doctors were called and recovery was pronounced possible. After months of suffering both recovered. August Mueller is still living in the city. A lady by the name of McClellan, who had a dressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death and it was several days before her body was recovered. The following named men have been chiefs of the St. Paul fire department:   Wash M. Stees,   Chas. H. Williams,   J.C.A. Pickett,   W.T. Donaldson,   J.B. Irvine,   J.E. Missen,   Luther H. Eddy,   B. Rodick,   M.B. Farrell,   J.C. Prendergast,   Bartlett Presley,   Frank Brewer,   R.O. Strong,   John T. Black,   Hart N. Cook,   John Jackson. THE FIRST AMUSEMENT HALLS IN ST. PAUL. INCIDENTS CONNECTED WITH THE EARLY AMUSEMENT HALLS OF ST. PAUL--IRVINE HALL--DAN EMMET AND DIXIE--THE HUTCHINSONS--MAZURKA HALL, MOZART HALL, ETC. Very few of the 200,000 inhabitants of St. Paul are aware that the three-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners once contained one of the most popular amusement halls in the city. It was called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall. Dan Emmet had a minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an excellent company it was, too. There was Frank Lombard, the great baritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat on the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and a large number of others. Frank Lombard afterward achieved a national reputation as one of the best baritone singers in the country. He was much sought after for patriotic entertainments and political conventions. His masterpiece was the Star-Spangled Banner, and his great baritone voice, which could be heard for blocks, always brought enthusiastic applause. Some time during the summer of 1858 the Hutchinson family arranged to have the hall for a one-night entertainment. By some means or other the troupe got separated and one of the brothers got stalled on Pig's Eye bar. When their performance was about half over the belated brother reached the hall and rushed frantically down the aisle, with carpetbag in hand, leaped upon the stage, and in full view of the audience proceeded to kiss the entire tribe. The audience was under the impression they had been separated for years instead of only twenty-four hours.

The next evening Max Irwin was missing from his accustomed place as one of the end men, and when the performance had been in progress for about fifteen minutes Max came rushing down the aisle with carpetbag in hand and went through the same performance as did the lost brother of the Hutchinson family. The effect was electrical, and for some time Max's innovation was the talk of the town. Dan Emmet, though a wondering minstrel, was a very superior man and was his own worst enemy. He was a brother of Lafayette S. Emmett, chief justice of the supreme court of the State of Minnesota. The judge, dignified and aristocratic, did not take kindly to the idea of his brother being a minstrel. Dan was not particularly elated because his brother was on the supreme bench. They were wholly indifferent as to each other's welfare. They did not even spell their names the same way. Dan had only one \"t\" at the end of his name, while the judge used two. Whether the judge used two because he was ashamed of Dan, or whether Dan used only one because he was ashamed of the judge, no one seemed to know. Dan Emmet left a legacy that will be remembered by the lovers of melody for many years. What left the judge? When Emmet's company left St. Paul they got stranded and many of them found engagements in other organizations. Dan turned his attention to writing <DW64> melodies. He wrote several popular airs, one of them being \"Dixie,\" which afterward became the national air of the Confederate States. When \"Dixie\" was written Emmet was connected with Bryant's Minstrels in New York city, and he sent a copy to his friend in St. Paul, the late R.C. Munger, and asked his opinion as to its merits and whether he thought it advisable to place it in the hands of a publisher. Mr. Munger assured his friend that he thought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr. Emmet in placing it before the public. One of the first copies printed was sent to Mr. Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition was ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in the old concert hall building on Third street. \"Dixie\" at once became very popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in the country. Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he organized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States, starting from some point in Ohio in 1843. The father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and at one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of Ramsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished. A correspondent of one of the magazines gives the following account of how \"Dixie\" happened to become the national air of the Confederate States: \"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New Orleans. Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a march and war song for the grand chorus. A great many marches and songs were tried, but none could be decided upon until 'Dixie' was suggested and tried, and all were so enthusiastic over it that it was at once adopted and given in the performance. It was taken up immediately by the populace and was sung in the streets and in homes and concert halls daily. It was taken to the battlefields, and there became the great song of the South, and made many battles harder for the Northerner, many easier for the Southerner. Though it has particularly endeared itself to the South, the reunion of American hearts has made it a national song. Mr. Lincoln ever regarded it as a national property by capture.\" The Hutchinson family often visited St. Paul, the enterprising town of Hutchinson, McLeod county, being named after them. They were a very patriotic family and generally sang their own music. How deliberate the leader of the tribe would announce the title of the song about to be produced. Asa Hutchinson would stand up behind the melodeon, and with a pause between each word inform the audience that \"Sister--Abby--will--now--sing--the--beautiful--song--composed-- by--Lucy--Larcum--entitled--'Hannah--Is--at--the--Window--Binding-- Shoes.'\" And sister Abby would sing it, too. During the early part of the war the Hutchinson family was ordered out of the Army of the Potomac by Gen. McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments expressed in its songs. The general was apparently unable to interpret the handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the entire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the king of abolitionists--   \"John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave   And his soul is marching on.\" Gen. McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the entire American people. Before the war he was chief engineer of the Illinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St. Paul to see the future Mrs. McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj. R.B. Marcy of the regular army, who lived in the old Henry M. Rice homestead on Summit avenue. When Gen. McClellan was in command of the Army of the Potomac Maj. Marcy was his chief of staff. One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the following dispatch, published since the above was written: \"Chicago, Ill., Jan. 4, 1902.--John W.

Rice homestead on Summit avenue. When Gen. McClellan was in command of the Army of the Potomac Maj. Marcy was his chief of staff. One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the following dispatch, published since the above was written: \"Chicago, Ill., Jan. 4, 1902.--John W. Hutchinson, the last survivor of the famous old concert-giving Hutchinson family, which was especially prominent in anti-bellum times, received many congratulations to-day on the occasion of his eighty-first birthday, Mr. Hutchinson enjoys good health and is about to start on a new singing and speaking crusade through the South, this time against the sale and us of cigarettes. Mr. Hutchinson made a few remarks to the friends who had called upon him, in the course of which he said: 'I never spent a more enjoyable birthday than this, except upon the occasion of my seventy-fifth, which I spent in New York and was tendered a reception by the American Temperance union, of which I was the organizer. Of course you will want me to sing to you, and I think I will sing my favorite song, which I wrote myself. It is \"The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.\" I have written a great many songs, among them \"The Blue and the Gray,\" \"Good old Days of Yore,\" and some others that I cannot remember now. I sang the \"Blue and the Gray\" in Atlanta six years ago, at the time of the exposition there, and McKinley was there. I had the pleasure of saying a few words at that time about woman's suffrage. I wrote the first song about woman's suffrage and called it \"Good Times for Women.\" This is the 11,667th concert which I have taken part in.'\" The venerable singer is reputed to be quite wealthy. A few years ago one of the children thought the old man was becoming entirely too liberal in the distribution of his wealth, and brought an action in the New York courts requesting the appointment of a guardian to his estate. The white-haired musician appeared in court without an attorney, and when the case was about to be disposed of made a request of the judge, which was granted, that he might be sworn. After Mr. Hutchinson had made his statement to the court the judge asked a few questions. \"How is your memory?\" said the judge. \"Memory,\" replied the old man. \"I remember the flavor of the milk at the maternal fountain.\" The judge concluded that Mr. Hutchinson was fully capable of managing his own affairs. Concert hall, built in 1857 by J.W. McClung, had room for 400 or 500 people, but it was somewhat inaccessible on account of its being in the basement of the building and was not very much in demand. Horatio Seymour made a great speech to the Douglas wing of the Democracy in the hall during the campaign of 1880, and Tom Marshall, the great Kentucky orator, delivered a lecture on Napoleon to a large audience In the same place. On the night of the presidential election in 1860 a number of musicians who had been practicing on \"Dixie\" and other music in Munger's music store came down to the hall and entertained the Republicans who had gathered there for the purpose of hearing the election returns. There was a great deal more singing than there was election returns, as about all the news they were able to get was from the four precincts of St. Paul, New Canada, Rose and Reserve townships and West St. Paul. We had a telegraph line, to be sure, but Mr. Winslow, who owned the line, would not permit the newspapers, or any one else, to obtain the faintest hint of how the election had gone in other localities. After singing until 11 or 12 o'clock, and abusing Mr. Winslow in language that the linotype is wholly unable to reproduce, the crowd dispersed. Nothing could be heard of how the election had gone until the following afternoon, when Gov. Ramsey received a dispatch from New York announcing that that state had given Mr. Lincoln 50,000 majority. As that was the pivotal state the Republicans immediately held a jollification meeting. Tom Marshall was one of the most eloquent orators America ever produced. He was spending the summer in Minnesota endeavoring to recover from the effects of an over-indulgence of Kentucky's great staple product, but the glorious climate of Minnesota did not seem to have the desired effect, as he seldom appeared on the street without presenting the appearance of having discovered in the North Star State an elixer fully as invigorating as any produced in the land where colonels, orators and moonshiners comprise the major portion of the population. One day as Marshall came sauntering down Third street he met a club of Little Giants marching to a Democratic gathering. They thought they would have a little sport at the expense of the distinguished orator from Kentucky, and they haulted immediately in front of him and demanded a speech. They knew that Mr. Marshall was a pronounced Whig and supported the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but as he was from a slave state they did not think he would say anything reflecting on the character of their cherished leader. Mr. Marshall stepped to the front of the sidewalk and held up his hand and said: \"Do you think Douglas will ever be president? He will not, as no man of his peculiar physique ever entered the sacred portals of the White House.\" He then proceeded to denounce Douglas and the Democratic party in language that was very edifying to the few Republicans who chanced to be present.

The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper caper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward more particular in their choice of an orator. One night there was a Democratic meeting in the hall and after a number of speakers had been called upon for an address, De Witt C. Cooley, who was a great wag, went around in the back part of the hall and called upon the unterrified to \"Holler for Cooley.\" The request was complied with and Mr. Cooley's name was soon on the lips of nearly the whole audience. When Mr. Cooley mounted the platform an Irishman in the back part of the hall inquired in a voice loud enough to be heard by the entire audience, \"Is that Cooley?\" Upon being assured that it was, he replied in a still louder voice: \"Be jabers, that's the man that told me to holler for Cooley.\" The laugh was decidedly on Cooley, and his attempted flight of oratory did not materialize. Cooley was at one time governor of the third house and if his message to that body could be reproduced it would make very interesting reading. The Athenaeum was constructed in 1859 by the German Reading society, and for a number of years was the only amusement hall in St. Paul with a stage and drop curtain. In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent a part of the summer in St. Paul, and local amusement lovers were delightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn. During the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were given at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue. The cantata of \"The Haymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a hit, and old residents will recollect Mrs. Winne, Mrs. Blakeley and Prof. Perkins, who took the leading parts. Prof. Phil Roher and Otto Dreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some time after the close of the war. Plunkett's Dramatic company, with Susan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time before the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street. During the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were brought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place. In 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was built, and it was one of the principal places of amusement. The Hough Dramatic company, with Bernard, C.W. Couldock, Sallie St. Clair and others were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers. In 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so proficient did the members become that many of them were enabled to take charge of squads, companies and even regiments in the great struggle that was soon to follow. In 1860 the Ingersoll block on Bridge Square was constructed, and as that was near the center of the city the hall on the third floor was liberally patronized for a number of years. Many distinguished speakers have entertained large and enthusiastic audiences from the platform of this popular hall. Edward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson and John B. Gough are among the great orators who have electrified and instructed the older inhabitants, and the musical notes of the Black Swan, Mlle. Whiting and Madame Varian will ever be remembered by those whose pleasure it was to listen to them. Mrs. Scott Siddons, an elocutionist of great ability and a descendant of the famous English family of actors of that name, gave several dramatic readings to her numerous admirers. When Sumter was fired on, Capt. W.H. Acker used this hall as a rendezvous and drill hall for Company C, First regiment of Minnesota volunteers, and many rousing war meetings for the purpose of devising ways and means for the furtherance of enlistments took place in this building. In February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of St. Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave a social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds for the establishment of a library. It was a sort of dedicatory opening of the building and hall, and was attended by large delegations from the different churches. Quite a large sum was realized. A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning of what is now the St. Paul library soon opened up to the public. About 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social, and the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per year for permission to read them. Dr. T.D. Simonton was the first librarian. Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St. Paul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than doubled. A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of reading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum. The People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in the city. H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of entertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company. Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among the members. During the summer of 1858 Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Wallack came to St. Paul and played a two weeks' engagement. They were the most prominent actors who had yet appeared in", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f51a7160323c912396ad629e58d01cca", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": ", was the only real theatrical building in the city. H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of entertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company. Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among the members. During the summer of 1858 Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Wallack came to St. Paul and played a two weeks' engagement. They were the most prominent actors who had yet appeared in this part of the country. \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Macbeth\" were on their repertoire. Probably \"Macbeth\" was never played to better advantage or to more appreciative audiences than it was during the stay of the Wallacks. Mrs. Wallack's Lady Macbeth was a piece of acting that few of the present generation can equal. Col. R.E.J. Miles was one of the stars at this theater, and it was at this place that he first produced the play of \"Mazeppa,\" which afterward made him famous. A.M. Carver, foreman of the job department of the St. Paul Times, often assisted in theatrical productions. Mr. Carver was not only a first-class printer, but he was also a very clever actor. His portrayal of the character of Uncle Tom in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which had quite a run, and was fully equal to any later production by full fledged members of the dramatic profession. Mr. Carver was one of the first presidents of the International Typographical union, and died in Cincinnati many years ago, leaving a memory that will ever be cherished by all members of the art preservative. This theater had a  gallery, and the shaded gentry were required to pay as much for admission to the gallery at the far end of the building as did the nabobs in the parquet. Joe Rolette, the member from \"Pembina\" county, occasionally entertained the audience at this theater by having epileptic fits, but Joe's friends always promptly removed him from the building and the performance would go on undisturbed. On the second story of an old frame building on the southeast corner of Third and Exchange streets there was a hall that was at one time the principal amusement hall of the city. The building was constructed in 1850 by the Elfelt brothers and the ground floor was occupied by them as a dry goods store. It is one of the very oldest buildings in the city. The name of Elfelt brothers until quite recently could be seen on the Exchange street side of the building. The hall was named Mazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s took place in this old building. At a ball given in the hall during one of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A. Ward, bookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter of one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance of about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got married. They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was known all over the town the next day and produced great commotion. Miss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they were finally divorced without having lived together. For a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in this building. Heitz had participated in a number of battles under the great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the graphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often relate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster stew. During the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large buildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel. Mozart hall was on the Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner. At a sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls were thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was held for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary commission. Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the principal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword to the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the front. A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities on this plan, and the name of Col. Marshall of the Seventh regiment and Col. Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it was thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a large vote. The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side had some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number of votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close to carry off the prize. Col. Uline had been a fireman and was very popular with the young men of the city. Col. Marshall was backed by friends in the different newspaper offices. The contest was very spirited and resulted in Col. Uline capturing the sword, he having received more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last five minutes the polls were open. This fair was very successful, the patriotic citizens of St. Paul having enriched the funds of the sanitary commission by several thousand dollars. One of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge Square, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall.

In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more pomp and glory than any holiday during the year. The Pioneer Guards, the City Guards, the St. Paul Light Artillery, the St. Paul fire department and numerous secret organizations would form in procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the nation's first great hero would take place. Business was generally suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the following day. In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St. Paul for the first time. She was about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company. They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river towns. Their concert took place in the hall of the house of representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available place at the time. Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud by an incident that has never been printed. Two boys employed as messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations as it was possible for kids to conceive. After an hour or so of revelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated. In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall and an alarm of fire was sounded. The door leading to the house was forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned through the floor. The boys knew at once that it was their carelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids never got together. They could see visions of policemen, prison bars, and even Stillwater, day and night for many years. They would often get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they had yet been suspected. For more than a quarter of a century these two kids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts, and it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible predicament. A few days after Maj. Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and Stripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of party, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives for the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the dastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government. Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was packed and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of the building in order that all who desired might take part in the proceedings. Hon. John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided, assisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents. Hon. John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the principal speakers. Mr. Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for congress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested to hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict. It was very soon apparent that Mr. Gilman was in hearty sympathy with the object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great demonstrations of approbation. Hon. J.W. Taylor followed Mr. Gilman and made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr. Lincoln. There were a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted pledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling on the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly forming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid when necessary to the dependant families of those left behind. Similar meetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times before the Rebellion was subdued. The first Republican state convention after the state was admitted into the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives. The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time and Col. Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for representatives in congress. Col. Aldrich did not pretend to be much of an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while he was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his associates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and he promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to promote the success of the ticket. Aromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built in 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of the war. The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of the social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by the Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day. The Pioneer Guards disbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members were officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole away and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's staff during the entire war. Col. Wilkin Col. King, Col. Farrell, Capt. Coates, Capt. Van Slyke, Capt. Western, Lieut. Zernberg and Lieut. Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others followed as the war progressed. It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St. Paul could boast of a genuine opera house. The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street, on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local talent. The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at auction, the", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-184afd23de097cea7ecadc6dfb1a7139", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": ". Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others followed as the war progressed. It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St. Paul could boast of a genuine opera house. The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street, on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local talent. The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who paid $72 for a seat in the parquet. This man Philbrick was a visitor in St. Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him. It was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people were sure that he was at least a duke. He disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared. It was learned afterward that this mysterious person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark. The first regular company to occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily Melville as the chief attraction. This little theater could seat about 1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed. Wendell Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and many others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old opera house. An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was in St. Paul. Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before the lecture was to commence, and when Mr. Douglass commenced speaking there was standing room only. A couple of enthusiastic Republicans found standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in front of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of W.H. Shelley. Mr. Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in local Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous swing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to do was to swing around with him. Consequently the Republicans who stood up behind Mr. Shelley thought they would have a little amusement at his expense. Every time Mr. Douglass made a point worthy of applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great demonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could only see the huge outline of Mr. Shelley they concluded that he was thoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the Republican fold. Mr. Shelley stood it until the lecture was about half over, when he left the opera house in disgust. Mr. Shelley was a candidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St. Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson, but as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked confirmation. About the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England a number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the Athenaeum. There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at that time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as possible. James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the Benecia boy. They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all the attendants necessary for properly staging the melee. It was prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out. And Hill has kept right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries, and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty years ago.

Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, \"the man behind the gun,\" received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of our early history. In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in St. Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the new territory of Minnesota. Accompanying him were two young printers, named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the great Northwest. These two young men quickly tired of their isolation and returned to their former home. They were soon followed by another young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his country's honor. Capt. E.Y. Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa., on the 25th of September, 1827. When a mere lad he removed to Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to take part in the campaign against the Mexicans. He was assigned to the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of hostilities. On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered to report to Gen. Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras. As soon as Gen. Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the leadership of Santa Ana. Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa Ana withdrew from Gen. Taylor's front and retreated toward the City of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the American forces under the command of Gen. Scott. Peace was declared in 1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St. Louis, where they were mustered out of the service. Capt. Shelly took passage in a steamer for St. Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849, being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota. The Pioneer was the first paper printed in St. Paul, but the Register and Chronicle soon followed. Capt. Shelly's first engagement was in the office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was employed by Mr. Goodhue at the time of his tragic death. When Col. Robertson Started the Daily Democrat Capt. Shelly was connected with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat consolidated. Capt. Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's battalion. Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they were mustered into service in September, 1861. They were ordered to report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry. In February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and surrender of Fort Donelson. Brackett's battalion was the only Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen. Buckner from receiving reinforcements. After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them. From Fort Donelson three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-501e774a64f7a58c082acf7597c0a211", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "ett's battalion was the only Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen. Buckner from receiving reinforcements. After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them. From Fort Donelson three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being Capt. Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen. Beauregard, who was only a short distance away. Brackett's company was sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen. Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen. Grant. This timely precaution enabled Gen. Buell to arrive at Pittsburg Landing just in time to save Gen. Grant from probable defeat. For three months after this battle Capt. Shelly's company was engaged in protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth, Miss. On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief. This attack of the rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February, 1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort Donelson. They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt. Shelly were injured. Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle. They were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes. Opposed to them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry officers in the Confederate service. A number of severe actions ended in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a prominent part. After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept on duty on the dividing line between the two forces. About the 1st of January, 1864, most of Capt. Shelly's company reinlisted and they returned home on a thirty days' furlough. After receiving a number of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864, received orders to report to Gen. Sully at Sioux City, who was preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux. On the 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march over the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana. It encountered the Indians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way. About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and the members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored region. In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where they went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since leaving Fort Snelling. Capt. Shelly was mustered out of the service in the spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has been engaged at his old profession. Capt. Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many stirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it could well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that \"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country, he would not in his old age have forsaken him.\" Political preferment and self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye, while others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of their lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an ungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung. OTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR. Capt. Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer office.

He enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four years, returning as first lieutenant. He now resides in Meadeville, Pa. Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both before and after the war. He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota cavalry. Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion were engaged in the real estate business. Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the war and foreman of the old St. Paul Press after the war. He enlisted during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier. No better soldier ever left the state. He was collector of customs of the port of St. Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press. The most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the United States, was the late Charles R. Stuart. He claimed to be a lineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart. For two years in succession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more type than any of his competitors. At an endurance test in New York he is reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in twenty-four hours. He was originally from Detroit. In the spring of 1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work. The Minnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one that day to help them out. Mr. Stuart was put to work and soon distributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he was going to do with it. After he had been at work a short time they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had distributed and probably more, too. When he pasted up the next morning the foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over and took a survey of Mr. Stuart, and then went back and measured it again. He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no one could discover anything wrong with it. The string measured 23,000 ems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in this section of the country. It was no uncommon occurrence for Mr. Stuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for the entire day. Mr. Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread all over the city in a short time and people used to come to the office to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to see the typesetting machine. In 1862 Mr. Stuart enlisted in the Eighth regiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant. For a number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which place he died about five years ago. He was not only a good printer, but a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything connected with the printing business. E.S. Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers. He served three years in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the Pioneer. M.J. Clum is one of the oldest printers in St. Paul. He was born in Rensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St. Paul in 1853. He learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late minister to Greece, and also with C.L. McArthur, editor of the Northern Budget. Mr. Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota, and took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion. J.B. Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the Union. At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St. Anthony Falls. During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who were attached to the First regiment. S J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days. In 1859 he went to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory. He was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion. For many years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last administration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska. M.R. Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business for some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth Minnesota during the rebellion. A.J. Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was connected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years. Robert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St. Paul offices at various times. He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley. William A. Hill came to St. Paul during the early '50s. He was a member of the Seventh Minnesota. Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in a hospital in Virginia. William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of sharpshooters in St. Paul, and they served throughout the war in the army of the Potomac. S. Teverbaugh and H.I. Vance were territorial printers, and were both in the army, but served in regiments outside the state. There were a large number of other printers in the military service during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their names are not included in the above list.

There were a large number of other printers in the military service during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their names are not included in the above list. TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE. One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to Minnesota at an early day was Mr. James Mills. For a time he worked on the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the editorial department, where he remained for a number of years. After the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for a number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post. Among the numerous printers of St. Paul who were musically inclined no one was better known than the late O.G. Miller. He belonged to the Great Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the city for a number of years. Mr. Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and when he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic hall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city. George W. Moore came to St. Paul in 1850, and for a short time was foreman for Mr. Goodhue. In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P. Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian. He sold his interest in that paper to Dr. Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by President Lincoln collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Louis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen. When he first came to St. Paul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser. For a long time he was one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press. He was a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity. At one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket. Had it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been nominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor. George W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers. He wore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he always appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than most of his co-laborers. He was elected state treasurer on the democratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office devoted his attention to the real estate business. Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M. Culver. He was the first delegate from St. Paul to the International Typographical Union. Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect how strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when taking the third degree of that noble order. Who has not heard of David Ramaley? He is one of the best as well as one of the best known printers in the Northwest. He has been printer, reporter, editor, publisher and type founder. Although he has been constantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active and energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out the century mark. H.O. Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and cleanest compositers among the territorial printers. He was employed on the Minnesotian. Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the printing business--printer, reporter, editor. He was a most estimable man, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to his reward. The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years familiar to most old-time residents. At one time he was foreman of the old St. Paul Press. He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids Sentinel. The old St. Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard Bradley. He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held the same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years. D.L. Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled \"Who Stole Ben Johnson's Spaces.\" He was employed in several of the St. Paul offices previous to the rebellion. The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St. Paul. He formed a partnership with Col. Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian. For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St. Paul, and held several other positions of trust. J.B.H. Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum, publishers of the Daily Times. For several years after the war he was engaged as compositor in the St. Paul offices, and is now farming in Northern Minnesota. Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet printer by the name of Wentworth. He was called \"Long Haired Wentworth.\" Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment. When Col. Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut. Wentworth would not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was summarly dismissed from the service. After being ordered out of the regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other political prisoners.

After being ordered out of the regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other political prisoners. He never returned to Minnesota. Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the publication of the first paper at Glencoe. At one time he was a compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state printer for Nevada. Andrew Jackson Morgan was brought to St. Paul by the late Col. D.A. Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat. He was a printer-politician and possessed considerable ability. At one time he was one of the editors of the Democrat. He was said to bear a striking resemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with any one without informing them of the fact. He was one of the original Jacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar, which he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was christened. No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume on one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver dollar. He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that the immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity. Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column was J.Q.A. Ward, commonly known as Jack Ward. He was business manager of the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper. The first immigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product of Jack's ingenuity. Jack created quite a sensation at one time by marrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room acquaintance. He was a very bright man and should have been one of the foremost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was his own worst enemy. Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour. His theory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business it was always better to give up the business. A.M. Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he was also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity. It was no uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to be printers. Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent actors were knights of the stick and rule. Frequently during the happy distribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist and the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would receive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled in a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat, but modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will receive their diplomas from the composing room. Since the introduction of the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the sociability that once existed in the composing room will be known hereafter only to tradition. The late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old Pioneer composing room. He was well posted on all topics and was always ready to take either side of a question for the sake of argument. Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that would have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would talk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often surprised and always entertained the weary distributors. At one time Jebb was reporter on the St. Paul Times. Raising blooded chickens was one of his hobbies. One night some one entered his premises and appropriated, a number of his pet fowls. The next day the Times had a long account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article he hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant. It was a fatal bull and was Mr. Jebb's reportorial finish. A fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous biography of Washington. The editor of the paper on which he was employed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate appearance. To make the matter more offensive the author on several different occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship to the editor who was compelled to apologize for it. In two different articles on nationalities by two different young printer reporters, one referred to the Germans as \"the beer-guzzling Dutch,\" and the other, speaking of the English said \"thank the Lord we have but few of them in our midst,\" caused the writers to be promptly relegated back to the case. Bishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times. A short conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he wasn't really a bishop. In an account of confirming a number of people at Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said \"Bishop Willoughby administered the rite of confirmation,\" when he should have said Bishop Whipple. He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder that he at once tendered his resignation. Of course it was not accepted. Editors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated than they are to-day. Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for economical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same room. All the offices contained blankets and cots, and as morning newspapers were only morning newspapers in name, the tired and weary printer could sleep the sleep of the just without fear of disturbance. Nearly all the early editors were also printers. Earle S. Goodrich, editor-in-chief of the Pioneer: Thomas Foster, editor of the Minnesotian; T.M. Newson, editor of the Times, and John P. Owens, first editor of the Minnesotian, were all printers. When the old Press removed from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner of Third and Minnesota streets, Earle S.

Goodrich came up into the composing room and requested the privilege of setting the first type in the new building. He was provided with a stick and rule and set up about half a column of editorial without copy. The editor of the Press, in commenting on his article, said it was set up as \"clean as the blotless pages of Shakespeare.\" In looking over the article the next morning some of the typos discovered an error in the first line. THE DECISIVE BATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS. THE FIRST BATTLE DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNION FORCES SCORED A DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE REBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED. Every Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made of the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion. At the outbreak of the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so intensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments volunteered at the first call of the president. As only ten companies could go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for a second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming. On the 16th of June, 1861, Gov. Ramsey received notice that a second regiment would be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized with two or three additions made up the famous Second Minnesota. H.P. Van Cleve was appointed colonel, with headquarters at Fort Snelling. Several of the companies were sent to the frontier to relieve detachments of regulars stationed at various posts, but on the 16th of October, 1861, the full regiment started for Washington. On reaching Pittsburgh, however, their destination was changed to Louisville, at which place they were ordered to report to Gen. W.T. Sherman, then in command of the Department of the Cumberland, and they at once received orders to proceed to Lebanon Junction, about thirty miles south of Louisville. The regiment remained at this camp about six weeks before anything occurred to relieve the monotony of camp life, although there were numerous rumors of night attacks by large bodies of Confederates. On the 15th of November, 1861, Gen. Buell assumed command of all the volunteers in the vicinity of Louisville, and he at once organized them into divisions and brigades. Early in December the Second regiment moved to Lebanon, Ky., and, en route, the train was fired at. At Lebanon the Second Minnesota, Eighteenth United States infantry, Ninth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments were organized into a brigade, and formed part of Gen. George H. Thomas' First division. On Jan. 1, 1862, Gen. Thomas started his troops on the Mill Springs campaign and from the 1st to the 17th day of January, spent most of its time marching under rain, sleet and through mud, and on the latter date went into camp near Logan's Cross Roads, eight miles north of Zollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove. On the night of Jan. 18, Company A was on picket duty. It had been raining incessantly and was so dark that it was with difficulty that pickets could be relieved. Just at daybreak the rebel advance struck the pickets of the Union lines, and several musket shots rang out with great distinctness, and in quick succession, it being the first rebel shot that the boys had ever heard. Then all was quiet for a time. The firing soon commenced again, nearer and more distinct than at first, and thicker and faster as the rebel advance encountered the Union pickets. The Second Minnesota had entered the woods and passing through the Tenth Indiana, then out of ammunition and retiring and no longer firing. The enemy, emboldened by the cessation and mistaking its cause, assumed they had the Yanks on the run, advanced to the rail fence separating the woods from the field just as the Second Minnesota was doing the same, and while the rebels got there first, they were also first to get away and make a run to their rear. But before they ran their firing was resumed and Minnesotians got busy and the Fifteenth Mississippi and the Sixteenth Alabama regiments were made to feel that they had run up against something. To the right of the Second were two of Kinney's cannon and to their right was the Ninth Ohio. The mist and smoke which hung closely was too thick to see through, but by lying down it was possible to look under the smoke and to see the first rebel line, and that it was in bad shape, and back of it and down on the low ground a second line, with their third line on the high ground on the further side of the field. That the Second Minnesota was in close contact with the enemy was evident all along its line, blasts of fire and belching smoke coming across the fence from Mississippi muskets. The contest was at times hand to hand--the Second Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence, firing and using the bayonet when opportunity offered.

The contest was at times hand to hand--the Second Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence, firing and using the bayonet when opportunity offered. The firing was very brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that the enemy had disappeared. The battle was over, the Johnnies had \"skedaddled,\" leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field. Many of the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered. After the firing had ceased one rebel lieutenant bravely stood in front of the Second and calmly faced his fate. After being called on to surrender he made no reply, but deliberately raised his hand and shot Lieut. Stout through the body. He was instantly shot. His name proved to be Bailie Peyton, son of one of the most prominent Union men in Tennessee. Gen. Zollicoffer, commander of the Confederate forces, was also killed in this battle. This battle, although a mere skirmish when compared to many other engagements in which the Second participated before the close of the war, was watched with great interest by the people of St. Paul. Two full companies had been recruited in the city and there was quite a number of St. Paulites in other companies of this regiment. When it became known that a battle had been fought in which the Second had been active participants, the relatives and friends of the men engaged in the struggle thronged the newspaper offices in quest of information regarding their safety. The casualties in the Second Minnesota, amounted to twelve killed and thirty-five wounded. Two or three days after the battle letters were received from different members of the Second, claiming that they had shot Bailie Payton and Zollicoffer. It afterward was learned that no one ever knew who shot Peyton, and that Col. Fry of the Fourth Kentucky shot Zollicoffer. Lieut. Tuttle captured Peyton's sword and still has it in his possession. This sword has a historic record. It was presented to Bailie Peyton by the citizens of New Orleans at the outbreak of the Mexican war, and was carried by Col. Peyton during the entire war. Col. Peyton was on Gen. Scott's staff at the close of the war, and when Santa Anna surrendered the City of Mexico to Gen. Scott, Col. Peyton was the staff officer designated by Scott to receive the surrender of the city, carrying this sword by his side. It bears this inscription: \"Presented to Col. Bailie Peyton, Fifth Regiment Louisiana Volunteer National Guards, by his friends of New Orleans. His country required his services. His deeds will add glory to her arms.\" There has been considerable correspondence between the government and state, officials and the descendants of Col. Peyton relative to returning this trophy to Col. Peyton's relatives, but so far no arrangements to that effect have been concluded. It was reported by Tennesseeans at the time of the battle that young Peyton was what was known as a \"hoop-skirt\" convert to the Confederate cause. Southern ladies were decidedly more pronounced secessionists than were the sterner sex, and whenever they discovered that one of their chivalric brethren was a little lukewarm toward the cause of the South they sent him a hoop skirt, which indicated that the recipient was lacking in bravery. For telling of his loyalty to the Union he was insulted and hissed at on the streets of Nashville, and when he received a hoop skirt from his lady friends he reluctantly concluded to take up arms against the country he loved so well. He paid the penalty of foolhardy recklessness in the first battle in which he participated. A correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial, who was an eye-witness of the battle, gave a glowing description of the heroic conduct of the Second Minnesota during the engagement. He said: \"The success of the battle was when the Second Minnesota and the Ninth Ohio appeared in good order sweeping through the field. The Second Minnesota, from its position in the column, was almost in the center of the fight, and in the heaviest of the enemy's fire. They were the first troops that used the bayonet, and the style with which they went into the fight is the theme of enthusiastic comment throughout the army.\" It was the boast of Confederate leaders at the outbreak of the rebellion that one regiment of Johnnies was equal to two or more regiments of Yankees. After the battle of Mill Springs they had occasion to revise their ideas regarding the fighting qualities of the detested Yankees. From official reports of both sides, gathered after the engagement was over, it was shown that the Confederate forces outnumbered their Northern adversaries nearly three to one. The victory proved a dominant factor in breaking up the Confederate right flank, and opened a way into East Tennessee, and by transferring the Union troops to a point from which to menace Nashville made the withdrawal of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green, Ky., to Nashville necessary. Confederate loss, 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners. Union loss, 248 in killed and wounded. Twelve rebel cannon and caissons complete were captured. Two hundred wagons with horses in harness were captured, as were large quantities of ammunition, store and camp equipments--in fact, the Union troops took all there was. Col. Fry's version of the killing of Zollicoffer is as follows: While on the border of \"old fields\" a stranger in citizen clothes rode up by his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder, and said: \"Don't let us be firing on our own men. Those are our men,\" pointing at the same time toward our forces. Col. Fry looked upon him inquiringly a moment, supposing him to be one of his own men, after which he rode forward not more than fifteen paces, when an officer came dashing up, first recognizing the stranger and almost the same instant firing upon Col", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-074a1e4bc4fa465f80f20624b8ddeb17", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "by his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder, and said: \"Don't let us be firing on our own men.

Fry. At the same moment the stranger wheeled his horse, facing Col. Fry, when the colonel shot him in the breast. Gen. Zollicoffer was a prominent and influential citizen of Nashville previous to the war, and stumped the state with Col. Peyton in opposition to the ordinance of secession, but when Tennessee seceded he determined to follow the fortunes of his state. The day before the battle Gen. Zollicoffer made a speech to his troops in which he said he would take them to Indiana or go to hell himself. He didn't go to Indiana. The poet of the Fourth Kentucky perpetrated the following shortly after the battle:   \"Old Zollicoffer is dead   And the last word he said:   I see a wild cat coming.   Up steps Col. Fry.   And he hit him in the eye   And he sent him to the happy land of Canaan.   Ho! boys, ho!   For the Union go!   Hip hurrah for the happy land of freedom.\" The loyal Kentuckians were in great glee and rejoiced over the victory. It was their battle against rebel invaders from Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, who were first met by their own troops of Wolford's First cavalry and the Fourth Kentucky infantry, whose blood was the first to be shed in defense of the Stars and Stripes; and their gratitude went out to their neighbors from Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio who came to their support and drove the invaders out of their state. On Feb. 24, 1862, the Second Minnesota was again in Louisville, where the regiment had admirers and warm friends in the loyal ladies, who as evidence of their high appreciation, though the mayor of the city, Hon. J.M. Dolph, presented to the Second regiment a silk flag. The mayor said. \"Each regiment is equally entitled to like honor, but the gallant conduct of those who came from a distant state to unite in subduing our rebel invaders excites the warmest emotions of our hearts.\" On Jan. 25 President Lincoln's congratulations were read to the regiment, and on Feb. 9, at Waitsboro, Ky., the following joint resolution of the Minnesota legislature was read before the regiment: Whereas, the noble part borne by the First regiment, Minnesota infantry, in the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, Va., is yet fresh in our minds; and, whereas, we have heard with equal satisfaction the intelligence of the heroism displayed by the Second Minnesota infantry in the late brilliant action at Mill Springs, Ky.: Therefore be it resolved by the legislature of Minnesota, That while it was the fortune of the veteran First regiment to shed luster upon defeat, it was reserved for the glorious Second regiment to add victory to glory. Resolved, that the bravery of our noble sons, heroes whether in defeat or victory, is a source of pride to the state that sent them forth, and will never fail to secure to them the honor and the homage of the government and the people. Resolved, That we sympathize with the friends of our slain soldiers, claiming as well to share their grief as to participate in the renown which the virtues and valor of the dead have conferred on our arms. Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, having the signature of the executive and the great seal of the state, be immediately forwarded by the governor to the colonels severally in command of the regiments, to be by them communicated to their soldiers at dress parade. The battle at Mill Springs was the first important victory achieved by the Union army in the Southwest after the outbreak of the rebellion, and the result of that engagement occasioned great rejoicing throughout the loyal North. Although the battle was fought forty-five years ago, quite a number of men engaged in that historic event are still living in St. Paul, a number of them actively engaged in business. Among the number are J.W. Bishop, J.C. Donahower, M.C. Tuttle, R.A. Lanpher, M.J. Clum, William Bircher, Robert G. Rhodes, John H. Gibbons, William Wagner, Joseph Burger, Jacob J. Miller, Christian Dehn, William Kemper, Jacob Bernard, Charles F. Myer, Phillip Potts and Fred Dohm. THE GREAT BATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST SANGUINARY BATTLES OF THE CIVIL WAR--TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE--GALLANT ACTION OF THE FIRST MINNESOTA BATTERY--DEATH OF CAPT. W.H. ACKER. The battle of Pittsburg Landing on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, was one of the most terrific of the many great battles of the great Civil war. It has been likened to the battle of Waterloo. Napoleon sought to destroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with Blucher. Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of the Tennessee, under Gen. Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland, under Buell, could come to his assistance. At the second battle of Bull Run Gen. Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns, yet he remained inactive. At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by military men that Gen.

Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland, under Buell, could come to his assistance. At the second battle of Bull Run Gen. Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns, yet he remained inactive. At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by military men that Gen. Buell could have made a junction with Grant twenty-four hours sooner and thereby saved a terrible loss of life had he chosen to do so. Both generals were subsequently suspended from their commands and charges of disloyalty were made against them by many newspapers in the North. Gen. Porter was tried by court-martial and dismissed from the service. Many years after this decision was revoked by congress and the stigma of disloyalty removed from his name. Gen. Buell was tried by court-martial, but the findings of the court were never made public. Gen. Grant did not think Gen. Buell was guilty of the charges against him, and when he became commander-in-chief of the army in 1864 endeavored to have him restored to his command, but the war department did not seem inclined to do so. About two weeks before the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Grant was suspended from the command of the Army of the Tennessee by Gen. Halleck, but owing to some delay in the transmission of the order, an order came from headquarters restoring him to his command before he knew that he had been suspended. Gen. Grant's success at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous of his popularity. He was ordered arrested by Gen. McClellan, but the order was held up by the war department until Gen. Grant could be heard from. The reason for his arrest was that he went to Nashville to consult with Buell without permission of the commanding general. Dispatches sent to Grant for information concerning his command was never delivered to him, but were delivered over to the rebel authorities by a rebel telegraph operator, who shortly afterward joined the Confederate forces. Many years after the war Gen. Badeau, one of Grant's staff officers, was in search of information for his \"History of Grant's Military Campaigns,\" and he unearthed in the archives of the war department the full correspondence between Halleck, McClellan and the secretary of war, and it was not until then that Gen. Grant learned the full extent of the absurd accusations made against him. After the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Halleck assumed personal command of all the forces at that point and Gen. Grant was placed second in command, which meant that he had no command at all. This was very distasteful to Gen. Grant and he would have resigned his commission and returned to St. Louis but for the interposition of his friend, Gen. W.T. Sherman. Gen. Grant had packed up his belongings and was about to depart when Gen. Sherman met him at his tent and persuaded him to refrain. In a short time Halleck was ordered to Washington and Grant was made commander of the Department of West Tennessee, with headquarters at Memphis. Gen. Grant's subsequent career proved the wisdom of Sherman's entreaty. When Gen. Halleck assumed command he constructed magnificent fortifications, and they were a splendid monument to his engineering skill, but they were never occupied. He was like the celebrated king of France, who \"with one hundred thousand men, marched up the hill and then down again.\" Gen. Halleck had under his immediate command more than one hundred thousand well equipped men, and the people of the North looked to him to administer a crushing blow to the then retreating enemy. The hour had arrived--the man had not. \"Flushed with the victory of Forts Henry and Donelson,\" said the envious Halleck in a dispatch to the war department, previous to the battle, \"the army under Grant at Pittsburg Landing was more demoralized than the Army of the Potomac after the disastrous defeat of Bull Run.\" Soon after the battle the venerable Gen. Scott predicted that the war would soon be ended--that thereafter there would be nothing but guerrilla warfare at interior points. Gen. Grant himself in his memoirs says that had the victory at Pittsburg Landing been followed up and the army been kept intact the battles at Stone River, Chattanooga and Chickamauga would not have been necessary. Probably the battle of Pittsburg Landing was the most misunderstood and most misrepresented of any battle occurring during the war. It was charged that Grant was drunk; that he was far away from the battleground when the attack was made, and was wholly unprepared to meet the terrible onslaught of the enemy in the earlier stages of the encounter. Gen. Beauregard is said to have stated on the morning of the battle that before sundown he would water his horses in the Tennessee river or in hell. That the rebels did not succeed in reaching the Tennessee was not from lack of dash and daring on their part, but was on account of the sturdy resistance and heroism of their adversaries. According to Gen. Grant's own account of the battle, though suffering intense pain from a sprained ankle, he was in the saddle from early morning till late at night, riding from division to division, giving directions to their commanding officers regarding the many changes in the disposition of their forces rendered necessary by the progress of the battle. The firm resistance made by the force under his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the charges made against him. Misunderstanding of orders, want of co-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of recruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter of the Union forces on the first day of the battle.

The firm resistance made by the force under his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the charges made against him. Misunderstanding of orders, want of co-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of recruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter of the Union forces on the first day of the battle. The battle of Pittsburg Landing is sometimes called the battle of Shiloh, some of the hardest lighting having been done in the vicinity of an old log church called the Church of Shiloh, about three miles from the landing. The battle ground traversed by the opposing forces occupied a semi-circle of about three and a half miles from the town of Pittsburg, the Union forces being stationed in the form of a semi-circle, the right resting on a point north of Crump's Landing, the center being directly in front of the road to Corinth, and the left extending to the river in the direction of Harrisburg--a small place north of Pittsburg Landing. At about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, Col. Peabody of Prentiss' division, fearing that everything was not right, dispatched a body of 400 men beyond the camp for the purpose of looking after any body of men which might be lurking in that direction. This step was wisely taken, for a half a mile advance showed a heavy force approaching, who fired upon them with great slaughter. This force taken by surprise, was compelled to retreat, which they did in good order under a galling fire. At 6 o'clock the fire had become general along the entire front, the enemy having driven in the pickets of Gen. Sherman's division and had fallen with vengeance upon three Ohio regiments of raw recruits, who knew nothing of the approach of the enemy until they were within their midst. The slaughter on the first approach of the enemy was very severe, scores falling at every discharge of rebel guns. It soon became apparent that the rebel forces were approaching in overwhelming numbers and there was nothing left for them to do but retreat, which was done with considerable disorder, both officers and men losing every particle of their baggage, which fell into rebel hands. At 8:30 o'clock the fight had become general, the second line of divisions having received the advance in good order and made every preparation for a suitable reception of the foe. At this time many thousand stragglers, many of whom had never before heard the sound of musketry, turned their backs to the enemy, and neither threats or persuasion could induce them to turn back. The timely arrival of Gen. Grant, who had hastened up from Savannah, led to the adoption of measures that put a stop to this uncalled-for flight from the battle ground. A strong guard was placed across the thoroughfare, with orders to hault every soldier whose face was turned toward the river, and thus a general stampede was prevented. At 10 o'clock the entire line on both sides was engaged in one of the most terrible battles ever known in this country. The roar of the cannon and musketry was without intermission from the main center to a point extending halfway down the left wing. The great struggle was most upon the forces which had fallen back on Sherman's position. By 11 o'clock quite a number of the commanders of regiments had fallen, and in some instances not a single field officer remained; yet the fighting continued with an earnestness that plainly showed that the contest on both sides was for death or victory. The almost deafening sound of artillery and the rattle of musketry was all that could be heard as the men stood silently and delivered their fire, evidently bent on the work of destruction which knew no bounds. Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow strip of open land dividing the opponents. Many who were maimed fell back without help, while others still fought in the ranks until they were actually forced back by their company officers. Finding it impossible to drive back the center of our column, at 12 o'clock the enemy slackened fire upon it and made a most vigorous effort on our left wing, endeavoring to drive it to the river bank at a point about a mile and a half above Pittsburg Landing. With the demonstration of the enemy upon the left wing it was soon seen that all their fury was being poured out upon it, with a determination that it should give way. For about two hours a sheet of fire blazed both columns, the rattle of musketry making a most deafening noise. For about an hour it was feared that the enemy would succeed in driving our forces to the river bank, the rebels at times being plainly seen by those on the main landing below. While the conflict raged the hottest in this quarter the gunboat Tyler passed slowly up the river to a point directly opposite the enemy and poured in a broadside from her immense guns. The shells went tearing and crashing through the woods, felling trees in their course and spreading havoc wherever they fell. The explosions were fearful, the shells falling far inland, and they struck terror to the rebel force. Foiled in this attempt, they now made another attack on the center and fought like tigers. They found our lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming. Every man was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite conclusion. In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements, under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the battle ground. They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel.

In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements, under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the battle ground. They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel. Volley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was re-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both sides. At 5 o'clock there was a short cessation in the firing of the enemy, their lines falling back on the center for about half a mile. They again wheeled and suddenly threw their entire force upon the left wing, determined to make the final struggle of the day in that quarter. The gunboat Lexington in the meantime had arrived from Savannah, and after sending a message to Gen. Grant to ascertain in which direction the enemy was from the river, the Lexington and Tyler took a position about half a mile above the river landing, and poured their shells up a deep ravine reaching to the river on the right. Their shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect. In the meantime Gen. Lew Wallace, who had taken a circuitous route from Crump's Landing, appeared suddenly on the left wing of the rebels. In face of this combination the enemy felt that their bold effort was for the day a failure and as night was about at hand, they slowly fell back, fighting as they went, until they reached an advantageous position, somewhat in the rear, yet occupying the main road to Corinth. The gunboats continued to send their shells after them until they were far beyond reach. This ended the engagement for the day. Throughout the day the rebels evidently had fought with the Napoleonic idea of massing their entire force on weak points of the enemy, with the intention of braking through their lines, creating a panic and cutting off retreat. The first day's battle, though resulting in a terrible loss of Union troops, was in reality a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders. They fully expected, with their overwhelming force to annihilate Grant's army, cross the Tennessee river and administer the same punishment to Buell, and then march on through Tennessee, Kentucky and into Ohio. They had conceived a very bold movement, but utterly failed to execute it. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate forces, was killed in the first day's battle, being shot while attempting to induce a brigade of unwilling Confederates to make a charge on the enemy. Gen. Buell was at Columbia, Tenn., on the 19th of March with a veteran force of 40,000 men, and it required nineteen days for him to reach the Tennessee river, eighty-five miles distant, marching less than five miles a day, notwithstanding the fact that he had been ordered to make a junction with Grant's forces as soon as possible, and was well informed of the urgency of the situation. During the night steamers were engaged in carrying the troops of Nelson's division across the river. As soon as the boats reached the shore the troops immediately left, and, without music, took their way to the advance of the left wing of the Union forces. They had come up double quick from Savannah, and as they were regarded as veterans, the greatest confidence was soon manifest as to the successful termination of the battle. With the first hours of daylight it was evident that the enemy had also been strongly reinforced, for, notwithstanding they must have known of the arrival of new Union troops, they were first to open the ball, which they did with considerable alacrity. The attacks that began came from the main Corinth road, a point to which they seemed strongly attached, and which at no time did they leave unprotected. Within half an hour from the first firing in the morning the contest then again spread in either direction, and both the main and left wings were not so anxious to fight their way to the river bank as on the previous day, having a slight experience of what they might expect if again brought under the powerful guns of the Tyler and Lexington. They were not, however, lacking in activity, and they were met by our reinforced troops with an energy that they did not anticipate. At 9 o'clock the sound of the artillery and musketry fully equaled that of the day before. It now became evident that the rebels were avoiding our extreme left wing, and were endeavoring to find a weak point in our line by which they could turn our force and thus create a panic. They left one point but to return to it immediately, and then as suddenly would direct an assault upon a division where they imagined they would not be expected. The fire of the united forces was as steady as clockwork, and it soon became evident that the enemy considered the task they had undertaken a hopeless one. Notwithstanding continued repulses, the rebels up to 11 o'clock had given no evidence of retiring from the field. Their firing had been as rapid and vigorous at times as during the most terrible hours of the previous day. Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson and Crittenden were present everywhere directing the movements on our part for a new strike against the foe. Gen. Lew Wallace's division on the right had been strongly reinforced, and suddenly both wings of our army were turned upon the enemy, with the intention of driving the immense body into an extensive ravine. At the same time a powerful battery had been stationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into the rebel ranks and with the most telling effect. At 11:30 o'clock the roar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being fired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory inspired. The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began to evince a desire to withdraw. They fought as they slowly moved back, keeping up their fire from", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-ad0c0360f449394f658f3f74f407457c", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "At the same time a powerful battery had been stationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into the rebel ranks and with the most telling effect. At 11:30 o'clock the roar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being fired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory inspired. The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began to evince a desire to withdraw. They fought as they slowly moved back, keeping up their fire from their artillery and musketry, apparently disclaiming any notion that they thought of retreating. As they retreated they went in excellent order, halting at every advantageous point and delivering their fire with considerable effect. At noon it was settled beyond dispute that the rebels were retreating. They were making but little fire, and were heading their center column for Corinth. From all divisions of our lines they were closely pursued, a galling fire being kept up on their rear, which they returned at intervals with little or no effect. From Sunday morning until Monday noon not less than three thousand cavalry had remained seated In their saddles on the hilltop overlooking the river, patiently awaiting the time when an order should come for them to pursue the flying enemy. That time had now arrived and a courier from Gen. Grant had scarcely delivered his message before the entire body was in motion. The wild tumult of the excited riders presented a picture seldom witnessed on a battlefield. Gen. Grant himself led the charge. Gen. Grant, in his memoirs, summarizes the results of the two days' fighting as follows: \"I rode forward several miles the day of the battle and found that the enemy had dropped nearly all of their provisions and other luggage in order to enable them to get off with their guns. An immediate pursuit would have resulted in the capture of a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns....\" The effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the 6th was 33,000 men. Lew Wallace brought 5,000 more after nightfall. Beauregard reported the rebel strength at 40,955. Excluding the troops who fled, there was not with us at any time during the day more than 25,000 men in line. Our loss in the two days' fighting was 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded and 2,885 missing. Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699, of whom 1,728 were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing. On the first day of the battle Gen. Prentiss, during a change of position of the Union forces, became detached from the rest of the troops, and was taken prisoner, together with 2,200 of his men. Gen. W.H.L. Wallace, division commander, was killed in the early part of the struggle. The hardest fighting during the first day was done in front of the divisions of Sherman and McClernand. \"A casualty to Sherman,\" says Gen. Grant, \"that would have taken him from the field that day would have been a sad one for the Union troops engaged at Shiloh. And how near we came to this! On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the hand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a slight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat. In addition to this he had several horses shot during the day.\" During the second day of the battle Gen. Grant, Col. McPherson and Maj. Hawkins got beyond the left of our troops. There did not appear to be an enemy in sight, but suddenly a battery opened on them from the edge of the woods. They made a hasty retreat and when they were at a safe distance halted to take an account of the damage. In a few moments Col. McPherson's horse dropped dead, having been shot just back of the saddle. A ball had passed through Maj. Hawkins' hat and a ball had struck the metal of Gen. Grant's sword, breaking it nearly off. On the first day of the battle about 6,000 fresh recruits who had never before heard the sound of musketry, fled on the approach of the enemy. They hid themselves on the river bank behind the bluff, and neither command nor persuasion could induce them to move. When Gen. Buell discovered them on his arrival he threatened to fire on them, but it had no effect. Gen. Grant says that afterward those same men proved to be some of the best soldiers in the service. Gen. Grant, in his report, says he was prepared with the reinforcements of Gen. Lew Wallace's division of 5,000 men to assume the offensive on the second day of the battle, and thought he could have driven the rebels back to their fortified position at Corinth without the aid of Buell's army. At banquet hall, regimental reunion or campfire, whenever mention is made of the glorious record of Minnesota volunteers in the great Civil war, seldom, if ever, is the First Minnesota battery given credit for its share in the long struggle. Probably very few of the present residents of Minnesota are aware that such an organization existed. This battery was one of the finest organizations that left the state during the great crisis.

The First Minnesota battery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall of 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain. Shortly after being mustered in they were ordered to St. Louis, where they received their accoutrements, and from there they were ordered to Pittsburg Landing, arriving at the latter place late in February, 1862. The day before the battle, they were transferred to Prentiss' division of Grant's army. On Sunday morning, April 6, the battery was brought out bright and early, preparing for inspection. About 7 o'clock great commotion was heard at headquarters, and the battery was ordered to be ready to march at a moment's notice. In about ten minutes they were ordered to the front, the rebels having opened fire on the Union forces. In a very short time rebel bullets commenced to come thick and fast, and one of their number was killed and three others wounded. It soon became evident that the rebels were in great force in front of the battery, and orders were issued for them to choose another position. At about 11 o'clock the battery formed in a new position on an elevated piece of ground, and whenever the rebels undertook to cross the field in front of them the artillery raked them down with frightful slaughter. Several times the rebels placed batteries In the timber at the farther end of the field, but in each instance the guns of the First battery dislodged them before they could get into position. For hours the rebels vainly endeavored to break the lines of the Union forces, but in every instance they were repulsed with frightful loss, the canister mowing them down at close range. About 5 o'clock the rebels succeeded in flanking Gen. Prentiss and took part of his force prisoners. The battery was immediately withdrawn to an elevation near the Tennessee river, and it was not long before firing again commenced and kept up for half an hour, the ground fairly shaking from the continuous firing on both sides of the line. At about 6 o'clock the firing ceased, and the rebels withdrew to a safe distance from the landing. The casualties of the day were three killed and six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward. The fight at what was known as the \"hornet's nest\" was most terrific, and had not the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels would have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a point dangerously near the Tennessee river. Capt. Munch's horse received a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself received a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service during the battle. After Capt. Munch was wounded Lieut. Pfaender took command of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during the day. On the morning of April 7, Gen. Buell having arrived, the battery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle that day. The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota engaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the struggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole rebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the commanding officer. It was the first battle in which they had taken part, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks before, they had not had much opportunity for drill work. Their terrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they had met a foe worthy of their steel. Among the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained field of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in the hearts of the patriotic people of St. Paul,--a name that was as dear to the people of St. Paul as was the memory of the immortal Ellsworth to the people of Chicago. Capt. William Henry Acker, while marching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with voice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray, was pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the ill-fated field. Before going into action Capt. Acker was advised by his comrades not to wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel bullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die he would die with his harness on. Soon after forming his command into line, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out by a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the. company to receive fatal injuries. \"Loved, almost adored, by the company,\" says one of them, writing of the sad event, \"Capt. Acker's fall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command.\" It was but for a moment. With a last look at their dead commander, and with the watchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns carried death into the ranks of his murderers. From that moment but one feeling seemed to possess his still living comrades--that of revenge for the death of their captain. How terribly they carried out that purpose the number of rebel slain piled around the vicinity of his body fearfully attest. The announcement of the death of Capt. Acker was a very severe blow to his relatives and many friends in this city. No event thus far in the history of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing sense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the battlefield. A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of freedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the nation's heroes.

The announcement of the death of Capt. Acker was a very severe blow to his relatives and many friends in this city. No event thus far in the history of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing sense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the battlefield. A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of freedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the nation's heroes. Capt. Acker was born a soldier--brave, able, popular and courteous--and had he lived would undoubtedly been placed high in rank long before the close of the rebellion. No person ever went to the front in whom the citizens of St. Paul had more hope for a brilliant future. He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight years of age at the time of his death. He came to St. Paul in 1854 and commenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon. Edmund Rice. He did not remain long in the law business, however, but soon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just been established by ex-Gov. Marshall. For some time he was captain of the Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming, and which was the finest military organization in the West at that time. In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a marching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham Lincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that exciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that great struggle that soon followed. Little did the captain imagine at that time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so soon be the means of his untimely death. At the breaking out of the war Capt. Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he thought he would be of more use to his country in active service and resigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota regiment, of which he was made captain. At the first battle of Bull Run he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in the Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had been recently created by act of congress. The Sixteenth regiment was attached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle, and Cat. Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day, being shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded at the first battle of Bull Run. As soon as the news was received in St. Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon. Henry Acker, left for Pittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his martyred son and bring the body back to St. Paul. His body was easily found, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the Second Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after the battle. When the remains arrived in St. Paul they were met at the steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to Masonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral. The funeral obsequies were held at St. Paul's church on Sunday, May 4, 1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that had ever attended a funeral in St. Paul, many being present from Minneapolis, St. Anthony and Stillwater. The respect shown to the memory of Capt. Acker was universal, and of a character which fully demonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St. Paul. When the first Grand Army post was formed in St. Paul a name commemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the organization. Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the cause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the heroic Capt. Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first association of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as Acker post. THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN. The terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of April 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling announcement that had been made during the long crisis through which the country had just passed. Every head was bowed in grief. No tongue could find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the fiendish act. The entire country was plunged in mourning. It was not safe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred president. At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity more deeply felt than in St. Paul. All public and private buildings were draped in mourning. Every church held memorial services. The services at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long be remembered by all those who were there. The church was heavily draped in mourning. It had been suddenly transformed from a house of hope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe. The pastor of the church was the Rev. Frederick A. Noble. He was one of the most eloquent and learned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the Henry Ward Beecher of the Northwest. President Lincoln was his ideal statesman.

The members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic. Many of their number were at the front defending their imperiled country. Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring a vigorous prosecution of the war. During the darkest days of the Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the Union seemed furthest off, Mr. Noble never faltered; he believed that the cause was just and that right would finally triumph. When the terrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet had ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was so paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating. Every member of the congregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly taken from them. The services at the church on the Sunday morning following the assassination were most solemn and impressive. The little edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed. He was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony. With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience. Had the dead body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity of the occasion could not have been greater. In the discourse that followed, Mr. Noble briefly sketched the early history of the president, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had accomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair. For more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the progress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight, when it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender of Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war, he was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin. \"With malice towards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right, as God gives us to see the right,\" were utterances then fresh from the president's lips. To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed a crime most horrible. There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience. Men and women alike wept. It was supposed at the time that Secretary of State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger. It was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice president and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt prove fatal. Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the time. His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign entanglements during the long and bitter struggle. He, too, was eulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly mournful. Since that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by the hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was terrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal as when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of Abraham Lincoln. AN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE IN TWO CHAPTERS. CHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST. As the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful summer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have been seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the North Star State to the Gulf of Mexico. He was on a mission of peace and good will to the red men of the distant forest. On nearing the shore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed on discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years preceded him. \"What, ho!\" he muttered to himself; \"methinks I see a paleface toying with a dusky maiden. I will have speech with him.\" On approaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation the voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to the paleface by her side. \"From the stars I see in the firmament, the fixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future destiny of man. 'Tis with thee. O Robert, to live always. This elixer which I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for countless generations. The possession of it will enable thee to conquer all thine enemies. Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground upon which some day a great city will be erected. Thou art destined to become the mighty chief of this great metropolis. Thy reign will be long and uninterrupted. Thou wert born when the conjunction of the planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude. As the years roll away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity. Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will often come before thee for adjustment. To be successful In thy calling thou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any subject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in the advocacy of their various schemes. Thou must not antagonize either side by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and the gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and thou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O Robert. thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed party that the result would have been far different had not thou been called suddenly away. Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all parties, and their votes are", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-b42797507f8eb83c3fc15fa42c44189b", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "withdraw from the scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O Robert. thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed party that the result would have been far different had not thou been called suddenly away. Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people. When the requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will come to thy aid. Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their displeasure will mean thy downfall. Let all the ends thou aimest at be to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the stars in their orbits.\" After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun. CHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY. After the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the frigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man. A wonderful change met the eye. A transformation as magnificent as it was bewildering had occurred. The same grand old bluffs looked proudly down upon the Father of Water. The same magnificent river pursued its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean. But all else had changed. The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side. Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded \"St. Paul's finest\" before leaving the shores of his native land. In the midst of this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the Okons, was the high and mighty ruler. The Okons and the followers of the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the paleface. Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic words: \"For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith,\" Verily the prophecy of the dusky maiden had been fulfilled. The paleface had become impregnably intrenched. The Okons could never be dislodged. With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons, the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface. SPELLING DOWN A SCHOOL. When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern part of Pennsylvania. It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that locality. The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known to-day. Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time. Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War to-day. It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under the peculiar conditions existing at that period. A school district that was able to support a school for six months in each year was indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil. Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a geography or grammar, but they were regarded as \"stuck up,\" and the other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far beyond their capacity. Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart each week for a spelling-match and recitation. We had our spelling match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest. I was considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to one of the great contests. One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to participate.

While the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination. I had not considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance. As soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them was from our school. I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line. They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers. When they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless. The school-master from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from his seat and said: \"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our school.\" My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the foot of the column. I felt very grateful towards our master for his compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct. The school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words, and I inwardly rejoiced. After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word \"phthisic.\" My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's lips. It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling book. It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to make way for the exercises to follow. As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word. \"Next!\" \"Next!\" \"Next!\" said the school-master, and my pulse beat faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to their seats. At last the crucial time had come. I was the only one left standing. As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said \"Next,\" I could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly spell the word. My countenance had betrayed me. With a clear and distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room I spelled out \"ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.\" \"Correct,\" said the school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness. I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark: \"I told you he could spell.\" I had spelled down four schools, and my reputation as a speller was established. Our school was declared to have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever after my name was not the last one to be called. On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat. HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS. Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth anniversary of his connection with the paper. A dozen of the old employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr. Moore at an informal dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event. Mr. Moore's service on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press. He has held his present position as the head of the composing room for about forty years. Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St. Paul from Tioga county, Pa., where he was born. He came with his brother, George W. Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian. His brother had been East and brought the boy West with him. Mr. Moore's first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St. Paul. There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns. Mr. Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a printer's \"devil.\" It is interesting in these days of water works and telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the office. He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now stands. Another of his jobs was to meet the boats. Whenever a steamer whistled Mr. Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office. It was from these papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world. He also was half the carrier staff of the paper. His territory covered all the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh street. There was no St. Paul worth mentioning beyond that. When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr. Moore went with it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr. Moore stayed with the merged paper. His service has been continuous, excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war. The Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest. While Mr. Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-14003429c48b9d2d45e7222249b39d12", "__created_at__": 1758347856, "content": "St. Paul worth mentioning beyond that.
