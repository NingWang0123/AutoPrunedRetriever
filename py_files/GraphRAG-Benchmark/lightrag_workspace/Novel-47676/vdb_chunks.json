Goodhue could revisit the earth and make a tour among the daily newspaper offices of St. Paul he would discover that wonderful strides had been made in the method of producing a newspaper during the latter half of the past century. Among the first things to attract the attention of this old-timer would be the web-perfecting press, capable of producing 25,000 impressions an hour, instead of the old hand press of 240 impressions an hour; the linotype machine, capable of setting 6,000 to 10,000 ems per hour, instead of the old hand compositor producing only 800 to 1,000 ems per hour, and the mailing machine, enabling one man to do the work of five or six under the old method. Think of getting out the Sunday Pioneer Press with the material in use fifty years ago. It would take 600 hand presses, 600 hand pressmen and 600 boys three hours to print the edition, and as there were no means of stereotyping in those days the forms would have to be set up 600 times, requiring the services of 5,000 compositors. Papers printed under these conditions would have to be sold for one dollar each, and there would not be much profit in it at that. The first daily papers printed in St. Paul were not conducted or a very gigantic scale, as the entire force of one office generally consisted of one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors and a business manager. A few reminiscences of the trials and tribulations of the early newspaper manager, editor and compositor may not be wholly devoid of interest. In 1857 there occurred in Minnesota an election of delegates to the constitutional convention to provide for the admission of Minnesota into the galaxy of states. The election was so close, politically, that when the delegates met there was a division, and the Republicans and Democrats held separate conventions. At the conclusion of the work of the two conventions the contract for printing was awarded to the two leading papers of the state--the Pioneer and the Minnesotian--the Pioneer to print the proceedings of the Democratic body and the Minnesotian that of the Republican. This contract called for the expenditure of considerable money for material with which to perform the work. Mr. Moore, the business manager of the Minnesotian, went to New York and purchased a Hoe press, the first one ever brought to the state, and a large quantity of type; also a Hoe proof press, which is still in use in the Pioneer Press composing room. When the book was about completed the business manager of the Minnesotian was informed that an injunction had been issued prohibiting him from drawing any money from the state until the question of the right of the Minnesotian to do any state printing had been determined by the district court. Mr. Goodrich was state printer and claimed he had a right to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies. This action on the part of the Pioneer produced great consternation in the Minnesotian office, as most of the men had not received more than half pay for some time, and now, when the balance of their pay was almost in sight, they were suddenly compelled to await the slow and doubtful action of the courts before receiving pay for their summer's work. The district court, subsequently confirmed by the supreme court, decided in favor of the Minnesotian, and the day following the decision Mr. Moore, of the Minnesotian, brought down a bag of gold from the capitol containing $4,000, and divided it up among his employes. In 1858, when the first Atlantic cable was laid, the news was anxiously looked for, and nearly every inhabitant of the city turned out to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the fastest boats on the river, which were expected to bring the news of the successful laying of the cable. The Gray Eagle started from Dubuque at 9 o'clock in the morning and the Itasca started from Prairie du Chien, about 100 miles farther up the river, at noon of the same day. When the boats reached the bend below the river they were abreast of each other, and as they reached the levee it was hardly possible to tell which was ahead. One of the passengers on the Gray Eagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message, tied up with a small stone on the inside of it, and as he threw it to the shore a messenger from the Minnesotian caught it and ran up Bench street to the Minnesotian office, where the printers were waiting, and the Minnesotian had the satisfaction of getting out an extra some little time before their competitors. In the summer season the newspapers had to rely, to a considerable extent, on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for telegraph news. There were three or four daily lines of steamers to St. Paul, and every one of them could be distinguished by its whistle. When it was time for the arrival of the boat bringing the newspapers from which the different papers expected to get their telegraphic news, messengers from the different offices would be at the levee, and as the boat neared the shore they would leap for the gangplank, and there was always a scramble to get to the clerk's office first. James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee awaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies of the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the adventurous kids from the newspaper offices. The Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the name of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county,", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-46289654522dd0ee1ffdeb77be06722d", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "clerk's office first. James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee awaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies of the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the adventurous kids from the newspaper offices. The Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the name of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov. Sibley called out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the lynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy. The Pioneer Guards was the crack military company of the state, and the only service any of its members ever expected to do was in the ballroom or to participate in a Fourth of July parade. When they were called out by the governor there was great consternation in the ranks. One of the members, who is still a prominent politician in the city, when told that his first duty was to serve his country, tremblingly remarked that he thought his first duty was to provide for his wife and family. A number of them made their wills before departing, as they thought the whole of Wright county was in open rebellion. After being absent for about a week they proudly marched back to the city without ever firing a gun or seeing an enemy. The late J. Fletcher Williams was city editor of the Minnesotian, and he wrote an extended account of the expedition, and It was profusely illustrated with patent medicine cuts and inverted wood type and border, the only available material at that time that could be procured. The year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of Minnesota. Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, both now living in this city, were the rival candidates for governor. The Republicans made extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative tickets, as both governor and United States senator were at stake. Among the speakers imported by the Republicans were the Hon. Galusha A. Grow of Pennsylvania and Hon. Schuyler Colfax of Indiana. Mr. Grow, then as now, represented the congressional district in Pennsylvania in which I formally resided, and I was very anxious to hear him, as the first political speech I had ever heard was made by him in a small village in Pennsylvania. The speakers were announced to speak at the old People's theater, on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, and I was among the first to enter. The theater was packed to overflowing. Mr. Grow had made a very interesting speech of about an hour's duration, and Mr. Colfax was to follow for an equal length of time. After Mr. Colfax had spoken about ten minutes an alarm of fire was sounded and in less than fifteen minutes the entire structure was burned to the ground. This happened about 9:30 o'clock in the evening, and, strange to relate, not one of the morning papers had an announcement of the fact the next day. The morning papers at that time were something like an evening paper of to-day. They were set up and made up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of the evening. The result of that election was very gratifying to the Republicans. I can see old Dr. Foster now writing a double column political head for the Minnesotian, the first two lines of which were: \"Shout, Republicans, Shout! We've Cleaned the Breech Clouts Out!\" Dr. Foster was the editor of the Minnesotian and was quite a power in the Republican party. He wielded a vigorous pen and possessed a very irascible temper. I have often seen him perform some Horace Greeley antics in the composing room of the old Minnesotian. At the time of the execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, I remember bringing the Chicago Tribune to the doctor, containing the announcement of the execution. I had arranged the paper so that the doctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance. The doctor looked at the headlines a second and then exclaimed, loud enough to be heard a block, \"Great God! In the nineteenth century, a man hung for an idea!\" At another time the doctor became very much enraged over some news that I had laid before him. In the early 50's Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, introduced into the house of representatives the first homestead law and the Republican party soon afterward incorporated the idea into their platform as one of their pet measures. After superhuman effort the bill passed the house of representatives, that body being nearly tie politically, and was sent to the senate. The Democratic majority in the senate was not very favorably impressed with the measure, but with the assistance of the late President Johnson, who was senator from Tennessee at that time, the bill passed the senate by a small majority. There was great rejoicing over the event and no one supposed for a moment that the president would veto the measure. When I laid the Chicago Tribune before the excitable doctor containing the announcement of Buchanan's veto the very air was blue with oaths. The doctor took the paper and rushed out into the street waving the paper frantically in the air, cursing the president at every step. From 1854, the date of the starting of the three St. Paul daily papers, until 1860, the time of the completion of the Winslow telegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the street with the full text of the president's message. The messages of Pierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding their arrival the various offices had all the type of every description distributed and all the printers who could possibly be procured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming message.", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c49b770a2f437d2a1478f52b0f2747ef", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "the time of the completion of the Winslow telegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the street with the full text of the president's message. The messages of Pierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding their arrival the various offices had all the type of every description distributed and all the printers who could possibly be procured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming message. It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to the foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified to be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle. One year one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would surprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In the city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the mail coach, and expected to return to St. Paul three or four hours in advance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage over his competitors. Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the stage left Chicago the message was delivered in St. Paul twenty-four hours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian had the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the complete message, long before he returned to St. Paul. The management always provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first out with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos to fully recover from its effect. As an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at this time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that in the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and Sayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic national convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats were in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated for president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on the way from the boat landing to the office would be: \"Anything from the prize fight? What is the news from the Charleston convention?\" \"The good old times\" printers often talk about were evidently not the years between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the Civil war in 1861. Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to speak of. When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it would be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with a new Bank Note Reporter. Married men considered themselves very fortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a grocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single men seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash. That was not more than half enough to pay their board bill. This state of affairs continued until the Press was started in 1861, when Gov. Marshall inaugurated the custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every Saturday night. Another instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily paper of that day: During the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and politicians visited St. Paul, consisting of State Senator W.H. Seward. Senator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, Senator Nye, Gen. Stewart L. Woodford and several others of lesser celebrity. The party came to Minnesota in the interest of the Republican candidate for president. Mr. Seward made a great speech from the front steps of the old capitol, in which he predicted that at some distant day the capitol of this great republic would be located not far from the Falls of St. Anthony. There was a large gathering at the capitol to hear him, but those who were not fortunate enough to get within sound of his voice had to wait until the New York Herald, containing a full report of his speech, reached St. Paul before they could read what the great statesman had said. In the fall of 1860 the first telegraph line was completed to St. Paul. Newspaper proprietors thought they were then in the world, so far as news is concerned, but it was not to be so. The charges for telegraph news were so excessive that the three papers in St. Paul could not afford the luxury of the \"latest news by Associated Press.\" The offices combined against the extortionate rates demanded by the telegraph company and made an agreement not to take the dispatches until the rates were lowered; but it was like an agreement of the railroad presidents of the present day, it was not adhered to. The Pioneer made a secret contract with the telegraph company and left the Minnesotian and the Times out in the cold. Of course that was a very unpleasant state of affairs and for some time the Minnesotian and Times would wait until the Pioneer was out in the morning and would then set up the telegraph and circulate their papers. One of the editors connected with the Minnesotian had an old acquaintance in the pressroom of the Pioneer, and through him secured one of the first papers printed. This had been going on for some time when Earle S. Goodrich, the editor of the Pioneer, heard of it, and he accordingly made preparation to perpetrate a huge joke on the Minnesotian.

Mr. Goodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five columns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies of the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian. The scheme worked to a charm. Amongst the bogus news was a two-column speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate just previous to the breaking out of the war. Mr. Seward's well-known ideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not questioned. The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting to be from the then excited Southern States. The Minnesotian received a Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition was distributed throughout the city. I had distributed the Minnesotian throughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to Bridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for being so late. He smiled, but did not speak. As soon as I learned what had happened I did not do either. The best of the joke was, the Times could not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus news from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to circulate when they heard of the sell. They at once set up the genuine news and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the Minnesotian for being so easily taken in. The Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was started, on the 1st of January, 1861. The Press made arrangements with Mr. Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another hitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain its telegraph from proof sheets of the St. Anthony Falls News, a paper published in what is now East Minneapolis. Gov. Marshall was very much exercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph news, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he had a very stormy interview with Mr. Winslow. No one ever knew exactly what he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic reports, and has had ever since. Gov. Marshall was a noble man. When the first battle of Bull Run occurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory. I remember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper as a young kitten. After the circus was out I went back to the office to see if any late news had been received. I met Gov. Marshall at the door, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the Union force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the country would never recover from it. But it did, and the governor was afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his country's honor. Printers were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for \"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that it was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a respectable appearance. The Press advertised for anything that could set type to come in and help it out. I remember one man applying who said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical knowledge of the business. One evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the late T.M. Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and told the foreman he thought he could help him out. He was given a piece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press. He was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems. Mr. Metcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the city over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press. The old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining until the paper was up. Although Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any other state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was necessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population was largely foreign. The feeling against the draft was very bitter, and the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did not take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they did not espouse. A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from the fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur. Arrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as possible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take place on the day designated by the war department. This situation of affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following characteristic reply was received: \"If the draft cannot take place, of course it cannot take place. Necessity knows no law. A. Lincoln.\" The bitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the old St. Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous prosecution of the war. Threats were made to mob the office. A company was organized for self-defense, and Capt. E.R. Otis, now of West Superior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post commander. Capt. Otis had seen service in the early part of the war and the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine military man for a leader. The office was barricaded, fifteen old Springfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought down from the capitol and every one instructed what to do in case of an attack. I slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building overlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my bed.

I slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building overlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my bed. I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the employes had gone home. As there was no possible avenue of escape in case of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed poor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard. But there was no riot. The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place without interruption. Before and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage of all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following Christmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made arrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third and Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert. It happened that on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had occurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg. The Pioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra on that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself. The news of these two great events had become pretty generally known throughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was simply intense. The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not propose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had been received. A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press office, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories. I had helped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the press room. As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed I attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale. As I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the counting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had become so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that direction, and undertook to retreat and try another route. But quicker than a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and walked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what few papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out. As soon as the magnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air, and cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a noise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St. Paul had celebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history. I arrived in St. Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and Immediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo. W. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper. I had not been at work long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was. Congress had passed a bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no telegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three days for the news to reach the state. The Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening before. It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was brought to St. Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of the Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same on the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers. The Minnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers and they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise. It was not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining news and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter. I could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops 'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860. During the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to expand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of our rapidly increasing population. The various papers were printed on single-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were introduced. In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the city, printing four pages at one time. In 1880 the different offices introduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines were installed. The next great advance will probably be some system of photography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer and proofreader. Who knows? THE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION. EARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST ATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS. \"Right this way for the Fuller house!\" \"Right this way for the Winslow house!\" \"Right this way for the American house!\" \"Merchants hotel on the levee!\" \"Stage for St. Anthony Falls!\" These were the announcements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would alight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith, Dubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling by steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper Mississippi.

Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house, the Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western house, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years attracted the attention of the visitor, and many others. The Merchants is the only one left, and that only in name. Messengers from newspaper offices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants looking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and the ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims, were among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the arrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected. At one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily line to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St. Louis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river. Does any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the combination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the little Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the Denmark? The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and when any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as a major general of the regulars. It was no uncommon sight to see six or eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance presented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time. The first boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage, and as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an effort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible. Traveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant, but it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the winter. Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough goods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive to ship goods by express during the winter. Occasionally some enterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing through the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express a new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters. The stages on most of the routes left St. Paul at 4 o'clock in the morning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty miles of the city could read the news as early as they can during these wonderful days of steam and electricity. Probably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much interest as the one known as the \"Five Million Loan Election.\" It was not a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it; although the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it at a later period. The only paper of any prominence that opposed the passage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr. Thomas Foster. That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who favored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an opposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor. The great panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business of every description and it was contended that the passage of this measure would give employment to thousands of people; that the rumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the state, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be able to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a few dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by any ordinary methods of speculation. The campaign was short and the amendment carried by an immense majority. So nearly unanimous was the sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was extremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to it. The city of St. Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a majority of over 4,000 for the law. There was no Australian law at that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of molestation. One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in opposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O. Sweeney, now a resident of Duluth. It was lithographed and widely circulated. The newspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time. They had to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers. It was proposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to donate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every mile of road graded and ready to iron. Work Was commenced soon after the passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the railroad companies upon Gov. Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in accordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the state. Gov. Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of the state had been fully protected. The railroad companies would not accept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they obtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they be issued. The governor held that the supreme court had no authority to coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the advice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction between the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the mandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds. Judge Flandrau dissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas prevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly improved. Dr. Foster did not believe Gov. Sibley was sincere in his efforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with the same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall. The doctor would never acknowledge that Gov.

Sibley was sincere in his efforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with the same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall. The doctor would never acknowledge that Gov. Sibley was the legal governor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign the bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the principal nor the interest would ever be paid. The Minnesotian carried at the head of its columns the words \"Official Paper of the City,\" and it was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials, denouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would be construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the people in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a bad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds. An effort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of its official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to abrogate its contract. Threats were made to throw the office into the river, but they did not materialize. When Gov. Sibley endeavored to place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted with conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and humiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt. The bonds could not be negotiated. The whole railway construction scheme suddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of the state was compromised, \"and enterprise of great pith and moment had turned their currents awry.\" The evil forbodings of the Minnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years the repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her otherwise spotless record. Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on which the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to new organizations. During the administration of Gov. Pillsbury the state compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per cent of their nominal value. Will she ever pay the rest? In the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee between the Sioux and the Chippewas. A party of Chippewa warriors, under the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a body of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly opened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty. Eight or ten Chippewas were killed during the engagement. The daily papers sent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that vicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements. Among the reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the Eastern cities. He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and furnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of the preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable to find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\" As the Sioux and Chippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded considerable amusement to the old inhabitants. The celebration in St. Paul in honor of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858, was one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations that ever occurred in the city. The announcement of the completion of the enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did not reach St. Paul until two or three days later, as there was no telegraphic communication to the city at that time. As soon as messages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President Buchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand celebration. Most of the cities throughout the United States were making preparations to celebrate on that day, and St. Paul did not propose to be outdone. The city council appropriated several hundred dollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination. An elaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit to the city at the present time marched through the principal streets, to the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and surrounding country. To show that a procession in the olden time was very similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of procession is appended: THE PROCESSION.   Escort of Light Cavalry.   Band.   Pioneer Guard.   City Guard.   City Battery.   Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,     representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,     the different States of the Union, and     other devices.   The Governor and State Officers in carriages.   The Judges of the State in carriages.   The Clergy.   Officers of the Army.   Officers of the Navy.   The Municipal Authorities of Neighboring Cities.   The Board of Education in Carriages.   The Mayor and City Council.   Knights Templars on Horseback.   Band.   Odd Fellows.   Druids.   Typographical Corps.   Band.   Officers and Crews of Vessels in Port.   Turners.   German Reading Society.   German Singing Society.   Attaches of Postoffice Department.   Citizens in Carriages.

The Pioneer Guards, the oldest military company in the state, had the right of line. They had just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the drum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days, presented a very imposing appearance. The Pioneer Guards were followed by the City Guards, under Capt. John O'Gorman. A detachment of cavalry and the City Battery completed the military part of the affair. The fire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H. Williams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha Engine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was the next in order. One of the most attractive features of the occasion was the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company. In a large car drawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of printers and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several epochs in the life of the great philosopher. In the car with the representatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a beautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's theater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear. She represented the Goddess of Liberty. The car was ornamented with flowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions \"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\" The Pioneer book bindery was also represented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female, were employed in different branches of the business. These beautiful floats were artistically designed by George H. Colgrave, who is still in the service of the Pioneer Press company. One of the unique features of the parade, and one that attracted great attention, was a light brigade, consisting of a number of school children mounted, and they acted as a guard of honor to the president and queen. In an open barouche drawn by four horses were seated two juvenile representatives of President Buchanan and Queen Victoria. The representative of British royalty was Miss Rosa Larpenteur, daughter of A.L. Larpenteur, and the first child born of white parents in St. Paul. James Buchanan was represented by George Folsom, also a product of the city. Col. R.E.J. Miles and Miss Emily Dow, the stars at the People's theater, were in the line of march on two handsomely caparisoned horses, dressed in Continental costume, representing George and Martha Washington. The colonel looked like the veritable Father of His Country. There were a number of other floats, and nearly all the secret societies of the city were in line. The procession was nearly two miles in length and they marched three and one-half hours before reaching their destination. To show the difference between a line of march at that time and one at the present day, the following is given: THE LINE OF MARCH. Up St. Anthony street to Fort street, up Fort street to Ramsey street, then countermarch down Fort to Fourth street, down Fourth street to Minnesota street, up Minnesota street to Seventh street, down Seventh street to Jackson street, up Jackson street to Eighth street, down Eighth street to Broadway, down Broadway to Seventh street, up Seventh street to Jackson street, down Jackson street to Third street, up Third street to Market street. Ex-Gov. W.A. Gorman and ex-Gov. Alex. Ramsey were the orators of the occasion, and they delivered very lengthy addresses. It had been arranged to have extensive fireworks in the evening, but on account of the storm they had to be postponed until the following night. It was a strange coincidence that on the very day of the celebration the last message was exchanged between England and America. The cable had been in successful operation about four weeks and 129 messages were received from England and 271 sent from America. In 1866 a new company succeeded in laying the cable which is in successful operation to-day. Four attempts were made before the enterprise was successful--the first in 1857, the second in 1858, the third in 1863 and the successful one in 1865. Cyrus W. Field, the projector of the enterprise, received the unanimous thanks of congress, and would have been knighted by Great Britain had Mr. Field thought it proper to accept such honor. Some time during the early '50s a secret order known as the Sons of Malta was organized in one of the Eastern states, and its membership increased throughout the West with as much rapidity as the Vandals and Goths increased their numbers during the declining years of the Roman Empire. Two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a charter from Pittesburg in 1858 and instituted a lodge in St. Paul. It was a grand success from the start. Merchants, lawyers, doctors, printers, and in fact half of the male population, was soon enrolled in the membership of the order. There was something so grand, gloomy and peculiar about the initiation that made it certain that as soon as one victim had run the gauntlet he would not be satisfied until another one had been procured. When a candidate had been proposed for membership the whole lodge acted as a committee of investigation, and if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his dealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when being examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the order--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from the manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had been removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that his confession had been made to the full", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-009fdf8cbf7983837bf283e7b7bb7b52", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "of investigation, and if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his dealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when being examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the order--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from the manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had been removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that his confession had been made to the full membership of the order. Occasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a transgresser than his questioners had anticipated. The following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for admission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of the acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand Commander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake nights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand Commander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an immense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the candidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come. The scheme of bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular during the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been original with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the many atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order. Some time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the order from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St. Paul. Among the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett of Cincinnati, and Gov. Alexander Randall of Wisconsin. They arrived at the lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall of the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them. The visitors were arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads, and looked more like the prisoners in the play of \"Lucretia Borgia\" than members of modern civilization. On the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha Falls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole. This organization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour one of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev. John Penman to consent to become one of its members. Mr. Penman was so highly Indignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the initiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work, with numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper's Weekly. The exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines, and ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented a dark and gloomy appearance. The reverend gentleman was judge of probate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly diminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his advantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere. The Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never cherished much love for each other. The ravings of the Eatanswill Gazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little papers in describing the shortcomings of their \"vile and reptile contemporary.\" After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known that the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the managers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively campaign for the office of state printer. Both papers had worked hard for the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims on the party for recognition. Both offices were badly in need of financial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful one of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend. How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the problem that confronted the legislature about to assemble. The war of words between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity. The editor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times as \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson\"--his right name being Thomas M. Newson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr. Foster as the \"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian.\" To effect a reconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic talent of the party leaders. After frequent consultations between the leading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was arranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the paper should be the Minnesotian and Times. It can readily be seen that a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was not likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity. The relations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one management than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate. This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature adjourned, when the partnership was dissolved. Dr. Foster assumed entire control of the Minnesotian and Maj. Newson was manager of the Times. George W. Moore was associated with Dr. Foster in the publication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when the offices separated it was stipulated that Mr. Moore should have the printing of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part payment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson, Moore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the paper he helped to found.

After the arrangement was made it was with the greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville Brown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state printer and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that village. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with its material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the Minnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender to its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire plant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr. Foster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in the volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W. Moore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Does any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North Star? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever have chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During the presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the Douglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There were only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of Mr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson Independent--and as they had been designated by the president to publish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary to print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the administration colors at the head of their columns. They were called \"bread and butter papers.\" The supporters of Mr. Breckinridge thought their cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an organ at the capital of the state. Accordingly the late H.H. Young, the editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that village and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance. It was not necessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a perfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily newspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six cases of type were all that were necessary. This paper was published regularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the officeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it soon collapsed. St. Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper history. It was called the St. Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by Dr. Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to Gov. Sam Medary. This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its violent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with much favor, and only existed about eight months. Some time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about half a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt. They could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one. Occasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the better of him and he would uncork a bottle. The experiment was never repeated. Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested in a printing office for more than two years. During the campaign of 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed political organizations intended to attract the attention of voters. One dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an active member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge Square as they were returning to their hall after a long march. In order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two organisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian office in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this nauseating beverage. It was a golden opportunity. The invitation was readily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the advocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black Republican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky. Bottle after bottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats of these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much gusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation that produced his twenty years' sleep. One of the cardinal principles of the Democracy, at that time was to \"love rum and hate <DW65>s.\" As the entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of march, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of their platform was rigidly adhered to.

NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH COULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL. In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations calling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of reinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern rebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond; the army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe reverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not been able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy; rebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in Kentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f2440d11a9db0e7c5ec428e134dc47e0", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond; the army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe reverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not been able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy; rebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in Kentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant watch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which they readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid in the prosecution of their cause. France was preparing to invade Mexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment of a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister republic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save Russia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to the success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention in behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the government in the North were especially active in their efforts to prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president; conspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by government detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring to spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North. It was during this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression of the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the history of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of Minnesota. It can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope with an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be. By the terms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the Sioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide on each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big Stone lake. In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river was sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow. The selling of this strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little Crow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction. The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the south side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor. There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits of civilization and worked like white men. This was very distasteful to many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before the treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game and sell fur to traders. The government built houses for those who desired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them how to farm. At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak they had several hundred acres of land under cultivation. The disinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced dissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the white man's party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and the Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who believed it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform manual labor. The white man's, or farmer's party, was favored by the government, some of them having fine houses built for them. The other Indians did not like this, and became envious of them because they discontinued the customs of the tribe. There was even said to have been a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was to declare war upon the whites. The Indians also claimed that they were not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely entirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they were ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the paymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and often leaving many of them in debt. They protested against permitting the traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and deduct from their small annuities the amount due them. They had at least one white man's idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they got ready. For several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the agencies to get their money. Day after day and week after week passed and there was no sign of paymasters. The year 1862 was the the second year of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been taxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war, it looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota. Many of the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money and their families were suffering. The Indians were told that on account of the great war in which the government was engaged the payment would never be made. Their annuities were payable in gold and they were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with. Maj. Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go South, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to believe that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and get their land back. It was believed that the men who had enlisted last had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they could clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and Chippewas would come to their assistance. It is known that the Sioux had been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief, but the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an understanding.

It was even said at the time that the Confederate government had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report and no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness. Under the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called upon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men mustered in when the news reached St. Paul that open hostilities had commenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the whites was taking place. The people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that they were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their indignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these treacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers of the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had, without a moment's warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of men, women and children. It was a singular fact that farmer Indians, whom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard to civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after hostilities had actually commenced. A few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency a portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county. There they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood. It was the first step in the great massacre that soon followed. On the morning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an indiscriminate massacre was inaugurated. A detachment of Company B of the Fifth regiment, under command of Capt. Marsh, went to the scene of the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their number, including the captain, killed. The horrible work of murder, pillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux reservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions of the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors. The Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and Seminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when compared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this terrible outbreak. In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed, several million dollars' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people rendered homeless. The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern boundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota river, had been in a twinkling depopulated. How to repel these invaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the state as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied, was the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national authorities. Shortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received, word was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were assuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and Chippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been influenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an indiscriminate massacre of the whites. Indian Agent Walker undertook to arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had scented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which caused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and they were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable tribes. The suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the extraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless settlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every side, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session of the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip volunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of shelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky warriors. Could anything be more terrible than Gov. Ramsey's picture of the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature? \"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages could wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from the category of their crimes,\" said the governor. \"Helplessness and innocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs, seemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage. Infants hewn into bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the murdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her pulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful tragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by these brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into captivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families burned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself with outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating the bodies of the dead. Such are the spectacles, and a thousand nameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian warfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people; and such the enemy with whom we have to deal.\" The old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble exception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men, women and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to Kandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver. Other Day was an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days, but experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak and had adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St. Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver, and in the course of a few", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-54b8fd90d2cdfb38f2203aba48e470d7", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "oted sixty-two men, women and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to Kandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver. Other Day was an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days, but experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak and had adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St. Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver, and in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll hall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of home guards, he said: \"I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the midst of evil. I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing. I have been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write. This I found to be good. I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and thus learned my vileness. At the present time I have fallen into great evil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men, women and children, without moccasins, without food and without a blanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my heart is glad. I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit.\" Other Day had been a member of the church for several years and his religion taught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct. It was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest. Ex-Gov. Sibley, on account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed in command of the troops ordered to assemble at St. Peter, and in a few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming, half-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition, commenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins. The newspapers and the people were crying \"On to Ridgely!\" which was then beleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl \"On to Richmond!\" previous to the disaster at Bull Run. Any one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of \"The Girl I Left Behind Me\" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the little garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the forces under command of Gen. Sibley. Fort Ridgely was a fort only in name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden buildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection when attacked by a large force. The garrison was under the command of Lieut. T.J. Sheehan. His force consisted of about 150 men from the Fifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of civilians. He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and equipped. Although there were only two attempts made to capture the garrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days. In addition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support and protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long expected, arrived there the day before the outbreak. After bravely defending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was relieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command of Col. McPhail, being the advance of Gen. Sibley's command. During the siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and spherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with busy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces and used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror among the redskins. Almost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in large numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident intention of burning and pillaging the village. Judge Charles E. Flandrau of this city, who was then residing at St. Peter, organized a company of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of that place. The judge received several acquisitions to his force while en route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of about 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience. They arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in driving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several citizens having been killed and a number of houses burned. Two or three days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded the town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts. After a desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge Flandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired. There were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or 1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had the Indian attack been successful. Provisions and ammunition becoming scarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the country to Mankato. They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded them with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the fight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested. Nearly two hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving nothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed barricade. The long procession of families leaving their desolated homes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes in the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the gallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a place of safety.

As soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A of the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul, and seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt. Jo Anderson, also of St. Paul, and several citizen volunteers, all under the command of Maj. Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with instructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could be found, from their perilous surroundings. They were St. Paul organizations and most all of their members were St. Paul boys. They never had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not familiar with the use of firearms. After marching for two days, during which time they interred a large number of victims of the savage Sioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from Fort Ridgely. The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of timber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet on the other. It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the command to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been known that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors. Maj. Brown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command. About 4 o'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or 600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate fire upon the almost helpless little command. For two days they bravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was found that about half their number had been killed or wounded. When the news of the disaster reached St. Paul there was great excitement. Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in their denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were responsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens. It was feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the savages. Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view of the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers. There was no telegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick and fast. Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh outrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover from the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be received. Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were arriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their houses to be destroyed. The situation was appalling, and many of our citizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail to check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin. Every boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees, and the people of St. Paul were often called upon to assist in forwarding them to their place of destination. Home guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened portion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms or ammunition and their services would have been of little account against the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked. Advertisements appeared in the St. Paul newspapers offering rewards of $25 a piece for Sioux scalps. Gov. Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and published in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents of the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of the Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley, 150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine county, 210 miles distant. This may have been gratifying to the residents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the frontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were seeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia. About 12 o'clock one night during the latter part of August a report was circulated over the northern and western portion of St. Paul that the savages were near the city, and many women and children were aroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the protection of the city authorities. It was an exciting but rather amusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the frontier. Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was not until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St. Paul felt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux. As soon as Gen. Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable him to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations. He had collected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including the Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of Capt. Mark Hendricks. The expedition marched for two or three days without encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of September several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment were fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake. About 800 of the command were engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal number of Indians. After a spirited engagement Col. Marshall, with about 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded in utterly routing them. Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty wounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with the whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After the battle Gen. Pope, who was in command of the department of the Northwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was over and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his command. This request of Gen. Pope was met with a decided remonstrance by the people", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN0olbFNcBAHC/IhpEwYNjgT3menOx3iEhYCUYhSJeaGpjVLzQSESC+uERDyQEpaKIAi6w18zsezNvZhdTKGpUvI3BCzG1mqq03ibyeYumirH9/Q0/zFZb/q4ulwvpTeoj4Sbf5qrRKmJT+Xa01tqhTjBW41/qB8GrsX2NICWKSSDc8H0x0LdBrtYIahgTqaYzclSzdSg8CUvJRw0pNrt40ZOl/QZaDIXZpln8kewbLg06NwlKCuplThL3ggdcXxBZ3+Z6zj7xWZSx6mYqsa6JD+LHeFKcp6qzavrpH5pt9AL7MWU/79SdQ3OtbuYL21viNX4pnbQ89WW7h4EFwtiIFbgfvBvxifUyfuk5hn9Fr+MeUD3AKDLb9cAznJ+j5FApjkpvjeswt5kKVnqhe8BM/+a7oGpikOcHJWLQdFcIkcwnaj+TmZ5C82MqVzuE7kYECwXCfLFTTWEuedZ5BqvZ4kV9BTGNob1J8bGBYpxEDFEjxeNCf7DXqbty8ADGjg+A9ezFuF6ghKqg0pw70Tz2hL7b0kp37nor9hMaQB97BByBZgtfixP03qLo/ZN5qqmBSwc7S7vhCXsCs4S4pCR4m313mRaciO1gnDHcO9GR6dJ1VS0AM30nBTOb7+pDh/LvgI524Bl8CJWrlNDbI75RU2MLqGzTe2IT+z7ZhTX7Rb1KUdW0QW1GFX0SFPO1bKcO2NfSQdROxCrDQAgm9enolC95J9Im6XwgDBfqafVmqso8F+2nZMFg3sFGsgidBXFiHigh8/0W1K7VK1Y2Eo8BnxoH1Fx9uceEut1r2FnUMk85EBgt9o3SJTr8P0YMtdThM43t/g2Sly+n13oHs6OUt6if7tI+/+7MLj8zlb/PHSM2en4nrwRugQ1CHVgsZHBDI/5p+6Nlvb6EKdaiWKDGqgeBWXgWRRN7qMtCIv+T2Fto8V9HP2pzYLNPhi+Z3ZZuIUHZxgeZznGHzSV8GV8ltMFjBt2QKq8BhXyWLxkudQI9rqzS9BntN4K4Z/0D8Kg0y7fB72Sm4dXa59xkIlj9AMca81lHQr11Wd0Wunf1V97dcAWczCSZylAq6maosG/Ya/Z9+DDcrKXRGuf3z6ZvazfMh1gfSMPXUAzORhW2cv8UfRKaIDwzwgMjULJ+HRTBcqfqOu+rQmed59A5IlwP5q+Tx+Frbyf0RoQr0519NKd1AsOB+/4zjIf2xXyL76tDiALWaR8JFilJ5AckQOvhWRxkZSiPTOkJ7AK+lRloj5GzuMtEm1oipMI0LLm+EPapsfCNzvEjLf8gHNYQVx2YxM+FS7V8Pc9PKJ6aRLLVtFf+d3wDvcQ3gHoijxWOGzH+RaAc/K5VBzKJVKk4chH9kKjg+ssvPDOoVeiJJVmB5NH/b+uII5Ev/rb2fc0lVdQXOyHsIGD9KWYnpLyUNYmf5u40VK3b0iGMsNnsk8gssWjHf7kL8lKwkLihEeIVFnF76h6zRzxLwSjbR1QOXwA28opuUqZqofR+uVl1sr+K47ySL48p15yyY6tbcfBDmRlWt/UuyKMbHXelKDCQrsXhXL45n52CW+RQODF+NKdJq6UKfwH+wRnjDyJ7cCW+zRLUe5hXopvSn9EjfKD3vfrvrF/DjfwnzHJIo1LHFlFgnUSlP4+7po2WRoRMZk4FUoxQ8q1w05eHLrquAQdRw9Q51ylR3o8djdikB0d2+99GFxllyjv0EGXHbuvbhZvENHpeoFD5RS5Uz9sylCrXKOFfscuoibxq7WG88j50zQRbdZE+ad5lCratowL9C+F/mOf8UyJMzEeJ0iFyo1xQ+55rE26HAa2YO4GuKNM8X5lvSgerQo12VyLqMn8Gs9VibQ0fzF+wRddmotHiAMxWLmQ4nE4Q3Ct2lvCCL2UHwxa1Fk+xPgGdal9gl1ZpQewuoYu8g6LpjVxzTBE5jfHBYOGVK55Y7ttFv+S8/kZ9i1RQy3NjzU/dM/Uc2MVdtc5FlFQpnY8sdBP4sI2zXrEsBXeYp7unCunWfC3H2UUc1StRglKnjWHb0K3IZ3C8rcL6AmcAVTxCtVTdwIQmGBvAcdak5NZJ7r+BVngnLsw/W3zDzdNy8WVs53ewBr+n+rTOSEd83xur1SDqgDRbuxk4JD0R7UQqO17YIat1wwRz/Bl2hWdO/QaURN+nb5hcvnrPPv1Tb6cehsO1q/xitY+dUjaxaz1RWj78Ern5gWClJw6slDK1076zOFzcJPS3vNg+232HGStnyaPhaNYuVKi745uZxZYuFQpQPW1axd9DYdItaThurKPiqkAy+djtoEjmHdlpmNQO07fREYO28ktwMfsX4pD3hvAH5InO0QJ2kznDfzAyeXAbHqKOM3K0Ezxt/av0lGmUM+jDdGvcOLU3ugwDRnn0DK6IzbH1dD3XnqMX3olajdYmiPAaWSYchD8J6bxLHhc1F/S0F9U8VEIDmYMn44X8zwjbiphytJ3N1prjeO5NbEacCL1UmZIPS+UxftBwRG8fZGWauCD8pVu37MOP5SG0g80Sb/PXtb3uI6DJPpFzEYLQ6k7HPbkPjZEojG9xzsfT1VJxLfMRFQIvsT3ZfLHJm0F26OONipp3lv8B8GyKAQ=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-7096033ca5d17f317a3de07c28f9b0bc", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ". Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty wounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with the whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After the battle Gen. Pope, who was in command of the department of the Northwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was over and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his command. This request of Gen. Pope was met with a decided remonstrance by the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the removal of any of the troops until they had made two long marches through the Dakotas and to Montana. Gen. Sibley's command reached Camp Release on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was located a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the massacres. They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods and white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to precede at once to their rescue. Gen. Sibley was of the opinion that any hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the prisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution. After a few preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the captives were released. As soon as possible Gen. Sibley made inquiries as to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes recently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of them had been guilty of the grossest atrocities. The general decided to form a military tribunal and try the offenders. After a series of sittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November, 321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of whom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms of imprisonment according to their crimes. All of the condemned prisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail constructed for the purpose. After the court-martial had completed its work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities, a great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale slaughter of the beloved red man. The Quakers of Philadelphia and the good people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president to put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution. The president, after consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the execution of only thirty-eight of the most flagrant cases, and accordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862. Previous to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed by Rev. S.R. Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions. Nearly every one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to them. Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and when speaking of their wives and children almost every one was affected to tears. Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of salvation, and expected to go at once to the abode of the Great Spirit. Rattling Runner, who was a son-in-law of Wabasha, dictated the following letter, which is a sample of the confessions made to Dr. Riggs: \"Wabasha, you have deceived me. You told me if we followed the advice of Gen. Sibley and gave ourselves up, all would be well--no innocent man would be injured. I have not killed or injured a white man or any white person. I have not participated in the plunder of their property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution and must die, while men who are guilty will remain in prison. My wife is your daughter, my children are your grandchildren. I leave them all in your care and under your protection. Do not let them suffer, and when they are grown up let them know that their father died because he followed the advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man to answer for to the Holy Spirit. My wife and children are dear to me. Let them not grieve for me; let them remember that the brave should be prepared to meet death, and I will do as becomes a Dakotah.\" Wabasha was a Sioux chief, and although he was not found guilty of participating in any of the massacres of women and children, he was probably in all the most important battles. Wabasha county, and Wabasha street in St. Paul were named after his father. After the execution the bodies were taken down, loaded into wagons and carried down to a sandbar in front of the city, where they were all dumped into the same hole. They did not remain there long, but were spirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a dissecting knife. Little Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the number that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a farmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson. His scalp is now in the state historical society. Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a few miles below St. Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian. Little Crow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish that his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom himself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the old man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute, quarrelsome and dangerous Indian.

Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians, he was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent assumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless struggle against the whites. Between the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there was great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the president should pardon the condemned. Meetings were held throughout the valley and organizations were springing into existence for the purpose of overpowering the strong guard at Mankato and wreaking summary justice upon the Indians. The situation became so serious pending the decision of the president that the governor was compelled to issue a proclamation calling upon all good citizens not to tarnish the fair name of the state by an act of lawlessness that the outside world would never forget, however great was the provocation. When the final order came to execute only thirty-eight there was great disappointment. Petitions were circulated in St. Paul and generally signed favoring the removal of the condemned Indians to Massachusetts to place them under the refining influence of the constituents of Senator Hoar, the same people who are now so terribly shocked because a humane government is endeavoring to prevent, in the Philippines, a repetition of the terrible atrocities committed in Minnesota. The balance of the condemned were kept in close confinement till spring, when they were taken to Davenport, and afterward to some point on the Missouri river, where a beneficent government kindly permitted them to sow the seed of discontent that finally culminated in the Custer massacre. When it was known that the balance of the condemned Indians were to be transported to Davenport by steamer. St. Paul people made preparations to give them a warm reception as they passed down the river, but their intentions were frustrated by the government officers in charge of their removal, as they arranged to have the steamer Favorite, on which they were to be transported, pass by the city in the middle of the night. St. Paul people were highly indignant when apprised of their escape. Little Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the outbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at Pembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling, where they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of 10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital punishment for their great crimes. Little Six confessed to having murdered fifty white men, women and children. One of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to contend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the frontier. There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to transport provisions was by wagon. An order was issued by the military authorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose, but the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient alacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it was necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly impressing into service of the government any and all teams that could be found on the streets or in stables. A detachment of Company K of the Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the city several days on that especial duty. As soon as the farmers heard that the government was taking possession of everything that came over the bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried it to Hastings. There was one silver-haired farmer living near the city limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with the South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could not locate his team. One of the members of Company K was a former neighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty to see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government. A close watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down to the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where he thought they would be safe until he returned. As soon as the old man passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses, and when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden with supplies for the troops at the fort. Of course the government subsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in this particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it. Gov. Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the military squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in charge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it exempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that a power higher than the governor required that team and that it must go to Abercrombie. And it did. It was necessary to send out a large escort with these supply trains and It was easier to procure men for that purpose than it was for the regular term of enlistment. On one of the trains that left St. Paul was a young man by the name of Hines. He was as brave as Julius Caesar. He said so himself. He was so heavily loaded with various weapons of destruction that his companions called him a walking arsenal. If Little Crow had attacked this particular train the Indian war would have ended. This young man had been so very demonstrative of his ability to cope with the entire Sioux force that his companions resolved to test his bravery. One night when the train was camped about half way between St. Cloud and Sauk Center, several of the guards attached to the train painted their faces, arrayed themselves in Indian costume and charged through the camp, yelling the Indian war hoop and firing guns in every direction. Young Hines was the first to hear the alarm, and didn't stop running until he reached St. Cloud, spreading the news in every", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-40ca577fc1aab8ffff670ab327655dda", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "ability to cope with the entire Sioux force that his companions resolved to test his bravery.

Young Hines was the first to hear the alarm, and didn't stop running until he reached St. Cloud, spreading the news in every direction that the entire tribe of Little Crow was only a short distance behind. Of course there was consternation along the line of this young man's masterly retreat, and it was some time before the panic-stricken citizens knew what had actually happened. In response to the appeal of Gov. Sibley and other officers on the frontier, the ladies of St. Paul early organized for the purpose of furnishing sick and wounded soldiers with such supplies as were not obtainable through the regular channels of the then crude condition of the various hospitals. Notices like the following often appeared in the daily papers at that time: \"Ladies Aid Society--A meeting of the ladies' aid society for the purpose of sewing for the relief of the wounded soldiers at our forts, and also for the assistance of the destitute refugees now thronging our city, is called to meet this morning at Ingersoll hall. All ladies interested in this object are earnestly invited to attend. All contributions of either money or clothing will be thankfully received. By order of the president, \"Mrs. Stella Selby. \"Miss M.O. Holyoke, Secretary.\" Mrs. Selby was the wife of John W. Selby, one of the first residents of the city, Miss Holyoke was the Clara Barton of Minnesota, devoting her whole time and energy to the work of collecting sanitary supplies for the needy soldiers in the hospitals. Scores of poor soldiers who were languishing in hospital tents on the sunburnt and treeless prairies of the Dakotas, or suffering from disease contracted in the miasmatic swamps of the rebellious South have had their hearts gladdened and their bodies strengthened by being supplied with the delicacies collected through the efforts of the noble and patriotic ladies of this and kindred organizations throughout the state. Many instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the field and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the imperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic wives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened crops. By reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in addition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the lands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about 750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000. Had they behaved themselves and remained In possession of this immense tract of land, they would have been worth twice as much per capita as any community in the United States. FIREMEN AND FIRES OF PIONEER DAYS. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ST. PAUL, FIRE DEPARTMENT--PIONEER HOOK AND LADDER COMPANY--HOPE ENGINE COMPANY AND MINNEHAHA ENGINE COMPANY--A LARGE NUMBER OF HOTEL FIRES. WHEN WE RAN WITH THE OLD MACHINE.   Brave relics of the past are we,     Old firemen, staunch and true,   We're thinking now of days gone by     And all that we've gone through.   Thro' fire and flames we've made our way,     And danger we have seen;   We never can forget the time     When we ran with the old machine.   In numbers now we are but few,   A host have pased away,   But still we're happy, light and free,     Our spirits never decay   We often sigh for those old days     Whose memory we keep green,   Oh! there was joy for man and boy,     When we ran with the old machine.                          --Gus Wiliams. Instruments for extinguishing fires were introduced in various parts of Europe more than three hundred years ago. The fire laddies of that period would probably look aghast if they could see the implements in use at the present time. One of the old time machines is said to consist of a huge tank of water placed upon wheels, drawn by a large number of men, and to which was attached a small hose. When the water in the tank became exhausted it was supplied by a bucket brigade, something on the plan in use at the present time in villages not able to support an engine. The oldest record of a fire engine in Paris was one used in the king's library in 1684, which, having but one cylinder, threw water to a great height, a result obtained by the use of an air chamber. Leather hose was introduced into Amsterdam in 1670, by two Dutchmen, and they also invented the suction pipe at about the same period. About the close of the seventeenth century an improved engine was patented in England. It was a strong cistern of oak placed upon wheels, furnished with a pump, an air chamber and a suction pipe of strong leather, through which run a spiral piece of metal. This engine was little improved until the early part of the last century. In the United States bucket fire departments were organized in most of the cities in the early part of the last century, and hand engines, used by the old volunteer firemen, did not come into general use until about fifty years later.

The New York volunteer fire department was for a long time one of the institutions of the country. When they had their annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock to the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day when a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed on exhibition. At the New York state fairs during the early '50s the tournaments of the volunteer fire department of the various cities throughout the state formed one of the principal attractions. Many a melee occurred between the different organizations because they considered that they had not been properly recognized in the line of march or had not been awarded a medal for throwing a stream of water farther than other competitors. A Berlin correspondent of the Pioneer Press many years ago, said that when an alarm of fire was sounded in the city, the members of the fire companies would put on their uniforms and report to their various engine houses. When a sufficient number had assembled to make a showing the foreman would call the roll, beer would be passed down the line, the health of the kaiser properly remembered and then they would start out in search of the fire. As a general thing the fire would be out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then return to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed. To Cincinnati belongs the credit of having introduced the first paid steam fire department in the United States, but all the other large cities rapidly followed. In the fall of 1850 the town fathers of St. Paul passed an ordinance requiring the owners of all buildings, public or private, to provide and keep in good repair, substantial buckets, marked with paint the word \"Fire\" on one side and the owner's name on the other, subject to inspection by the fire warden and to be under his control when occasion required. The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade, was made by R.C. Knox in the fall of 1851. Mr. Knox raised a small sum of money by subscription, with which he purchased several ladders, and they were frequently brought into requisition by the little band of men whom Mr. Knox had associated with him. Mr. Knox was a man of enormous stature, and it was said he could tire out a dozen ordinary men at a fire. Two public-spirited citizens of St. Paul, John McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, purchased in the East and brought to the city at their own expense the first fire engine introduced in the Northwest. Although it was a miniature affair, on numerous occasions it rendered valuable assistance in protecting the property of our pioneer merchants. Mr. Ritchie is still living, his home being in Philadelphia. In November, 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized under provisions of the city charter. A constitution and by-laws were adopted and the members agreed to turn out promptly on all occasions of fire alarms. As compensation for their services they were excused from jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military service, for the period of five years. The original constitution of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership roll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B. Pearson and George F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason; members, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward Heenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash. M. Stees, J.W. Stevenson, Benjamin F. Irvine, R.I. Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A. Ward, Charles J. Williams. Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the city at the present time. Mr. McCloud was a member of the firm of McCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on the southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets. This was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as Mr. McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly be called the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\" The old hook and ladder company was one of the representative institutions of the city. From the date of its organization up to the time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members. All of the property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856, having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of the city fathers. At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and ladders, and one fire engine with hose. Washington M. Stees was made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant. This scanty equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water could be readily obtained. The city fathers concluded to comply with the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August, 1858. They were soon tested and pronounced satisfactory. Our citizens then congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would be a thing of the past. One of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder company in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name of A.D. Martin. He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he usually went by the name of \"Johnny Martin.\" Now Johnny always kept his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-dd305fbce6d35b0ef2d81f49f11311ba", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "upon the possession of a first-class fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would be a thing of the past. One of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder company in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name of A.D. Martin. He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he usually went by the name of \"Johnny Martin.\" Now Johnny always kept his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell sounded he was \"Johnny on the spot.\" After the fire was over Johnny generally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would make a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman before he returned to work. He would accordingly provide himself with an immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he proposed to execute his sanguinary threat. Strange to relate he never succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it generally required two or three days to restore him to his former equilibrium. If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he would probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen would not be so difficult. In 1857 Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned the common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use. In the fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new engines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their headquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of Franklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new brick building on Third street, fronting on Washington. Michael Leroy was made the first foreman and R.C. Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were his assistants. The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge, Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T. Toal, J.H. Barstow, J.C. Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes, B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F. Masterson, John J. Williams and V. Metzger. During the fall of 1858 a large number of the most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival of the first steamer. In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine. Company No. 2 was organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner of Third and Jackson streets. The first officers were H.P. Grant, foreman; M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger, assistants; members, Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A. Cariveau, H.A. Schlick. C.D. Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R. Storing, William T. Donaldson, Daniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace, John McCauley and a number of others. The Minnehahas were a prosperous organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its members as had nothing particular to do. Rotary Independent Company No. 1 was the third engine connected with the St. Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the annual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located on lower Third street. By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from that time on the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department was one of the events of the year. The first parade occurred on the 12th of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following organizations:   Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.   Hope Engine Company No. 1.   Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2.   Rotary Independent Company No. 1. These four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line of march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the old city hall. In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever there was an alarm of fire. The uptown churches would ring their bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches in the central part of the city would ring their bells. There was a regular banging and clanging of the bells.   \"In the startled air of night,   They would scream out their afright,   Too much horrified to speak,   They could only shriek, shriek,   Out of tune.\" Every one turned out when the fire bells rang. Unless the fire was of sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact location of the fire could be determined. Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to relieve them for a short time.

As a general thing the appeal would be readily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the police to impress into service a force sufficient to keep the brakes working. Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to arrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse whenever the police were in search of a relief force. Upon the breaking out of the war a large number of the firemen enlisted in the defense of the country and the ranks of the department were sadly decimated. It was during the early part of the war that the mayor of St. Paul made a speech to the firemen at the close of their annual parade in which he referred to them as being as brave if not braver than the boys at the front. The friends of the boys in blue took serious umbrage at this break of the mayor, and the press of the city and throughout the state were very indignant to think that the capital city possessed a mayor of doubtful loyalty. The excitement soon died away and the mayor was re-elected by a large majority. There was not much change in the condition of the department until the arrival of the first steamer, Aug. 11, 1866. The new steamer was lodged with Hope Engine company, and an engineer and fireman appointed at a salary of $1,600 per year for the two. The boys of Hope Engine company did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer and took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded and St. Paul Hose Company No. 1 was organized, and they took charge of the new steamer. The rapid growth of the city necessitated the frequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and at the present time the St. Paul fire department has 211 paid men, 15 steamers, 4 chemicals, 8 hook and ladder companies and 122 horses. The volunteer fire department had no better friend than the late Mrs. Bartlett Presley. She was the guardian angel of the fire department. No night so cold or storm so great that Mrs. Presley was not present and with her own hands provide coffee and sandwiches for the tired and hungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames. She was an honored guest at all entertainments with which the firemen were connected, and was always toasted and feasted by the boys at the brakes. She will ever be remembered, not only by the firemen, but by all old settlers, as one of the many noble women in St. Paul whose unostentatious deeds of charity have caused a ray of sunshine in many sad homes. Mrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire department, but by every resident of the city. Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than the Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in exigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced operations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a jury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be down.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted, but his apartments were soon incinerated.

The first hotel fire of any importance was that of the Daniels house, located on Eagle street near Seven Corners, which occurred in 1852. The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred.

Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature was held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for several terms. The Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on Robert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery element. These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time of their destruction. On the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever occurred in St. Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third street near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on hand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach. Nearly all the buildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were two-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses occupied by the owners of the stores. When the fire was at its height it was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before the flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the firemen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had the immense smouldering mass under control. Thirty-four buildings, the largest number ever destroyed in St. Paul, were in ashes. Of the two blocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and the other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L. Larpenteur. The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the first hotels built in St. Paul was among the ruins. The New England was a feature in St. Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov. and Mrs. Ramsey had begun housekeeping in 1849. The Empire saloon was another historic ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first Pioneer, April 10, 1849. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also destroyed at this fire. In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was entirely destroyed by fire. A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene. A few pieces of furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular hotel. The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city. The hotel was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M. Winslow. Mr. Winslow was one of the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West. In some peculiar manner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building without any capital, but when the building was completed he not only had the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a financier as well as a builder. The proprietors of the Winslow were arrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were discharged. The American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was one of the landmarks of the city for a good many years. It was built in 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel as their headquarters. Although it was of very peculiar architecture, the interior fittings were of a modern character. On a stormy night in the month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this hotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire was beyond their control. The weather was bitter cold, and the water would be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose. Finding their efforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their attention to saving the guests. There were some very narrow escapes, but no accidents of a very serious nature. As usual, thieves were present and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and wearing apparel belonging to the guests. In the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story brick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets. It was occupied by them as a banking house for a long time. The business center having been moved further down the street, they were compelled to seek quarters on Bridge Square.

After the bank moved out of this building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them remodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about $20,000. It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized. When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom lost all they possessed. The Linden theatrical company, which was playing at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers. At this fire a large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street were destroyed. When the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were left standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city authorities, had not been demolished. Dr. Schell, one of the best known physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near the hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their lax enforcement of the law. One night at 10 o'clock the city was visited by a terrific windstorm, and suddenly a loud crash was heard in the vicinity of the doctor's office. A portion of the walls of the hotel had fallen and the little building occupied by the doctor had been crushed in. The fire alarm was turned on and the fire laddies were soon on the spot. No one supposed the doctor was alive, but after the firemen had been at work a short time they could hear the voice of the doctor from underneath the rubbish. In very vigorous English, which the doctor knew so well how to use, he roundly upbraided the fire department for not being more expeditious in extricating him from his perilous position. After the doctor had been taken out of the ruins It was found that he had not been seriously injured, and in the course of a few weeks was able to resume practice. During the winter of 1868 the Emmert house, situated on Bench street near Wabasha, was destroyed by fire. The Emmert house was built in territorial times by Fred Emmert, who for some time kept a hotel and boarding house at that place. It had not been used for hotel purposes for some time, but was occupied by a  family and used as a boarding-house for <DW52> people. While the flames were rapidly consuming the old building the discovery was made that a man and his wife were sick in one of the rooms with smallpox. The crowd of onlookers fled in terror, and they would have been burned alive had not two courageous firemen carried them out of the building. It was an unusually cold night and the <DW52> people were dumped into the middle of the street and there allowed to remain. They were provided with clothing and some of the more venturesome even built a fire for them, but no one would volunteer to take them to a place of shelter. About 10 o'clock on the following day the late W.L. Wilson learned of the unfortunate situation of the two <DW52> people, and he immediately procured a vehicle and took them to a place of safety, and also saw that they were thereafter properly cared for. On the site of the old postoffice on the corner of Wabasha and Fifth streets stood the Mansion house, a three-story frame building erected by Nicholas Pottgieser in early days at an expense of $12,000. It was a very popular resort and for many years the weary traveler there received a hearty welcome. A very exciting event occurred at this house during the summer of 1866. A man by the name of Hawkes, a guest at the hotel, accidentally shot and instantly killed his young and beautiful wife. He was arrested and tried for murder, but after a long and sensational trial was acquited. The greatest hotel fire in the history of St. Paul occurred on the night of Feb. 3, 1869. The International hotel (formerly the Fuller house) was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson streets, and was erected by A.G. Fuller in 1856. It was built of brick and was five stories high. It cost when completed, about $110,000. For years it had been the best hotel in the West. William H. Seward and the distinguished party that accompanied him made this hotel their headquarters during their famous trip to the West in 1860. Gen. Pope and Gen. Sibley had their headquarters in this building, and from here emanated all the orders relating to the war against the rebellious Sioux. In 1861 the property came into the possession of Samuel Mayall, and he changed the name of it from Fuller house to International hotel. Col. E.C. Belote, who had formerly been the landlord of the Merchants, was the manager of the hotel. The fire broke out in the basement, it was supposed from a lamp in the laundry. The night was intensely cold, a strong gale blowing from the northwest. Not a soul could be seen upon the street. Within this great structure more than two hundred guests were wrapped in silent slumber. To rescue them from their perilous position was the problem that required instant action on the part of the firemen and the hotel authorities. The legislature was then in session, and many of the members were among the guests who crowded the hotel. A porter was the first to notice the blaze, and he threw a pail water upon it, but with the result that it made no impression upon the flames. The fire continued to extend, and the smoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them completely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility. In the meantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the guests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their night Clothes. The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a crowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-2bf33d450055327352cd4545502529ee", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ", but with the result that it made no impression upon the flames. The fire continued to extend, and the smoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them completely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility. In the meantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the guests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their night Clothes. The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a crowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find their way to the street. The servant girls succeeded in getting out first, and made their way to the snow-covered streets without sufficient clothing to protect their persons, and most of them were without shoes. While the people were escaping from the building the fire was making furious and rapid progress. From the laundry the smoke issued into every portion of the building. There was no nook or corner that the flames did not penetrate. The interior of the building burned with great rapidity until the fire had eaten out the eastern and southern rooms, when the walls began to give indications of falling. The upper portion of them waved back and forth in response to a strong wind, which filled the night air with cinders. At last different portions of the walls fell, thus giving the flames an opportunity to sweep from the lower portions of the building. Great gusts, which seemed to almost lift the upper floors, swept through the broken walls. High up over the building the flames climbed, carrying with them sparks and cinders, and in come instances large pieces of timber. All that saved the lower part of the city from fiery destruction was the fact that a solid bed of snow a foot deep lay upon the roofs of all the buildings. During all this time there was comparative quiet, notwithstanding the fact that the fire gradually extended across Jackson street and also across Seventh street. Besides the hotel, six or eight other buildings were also on fire, four of which were destroyed. Women and men were to be seen hurrying out of the burning buildings in their night clothes, furniture was thrown into the street, costly pianos, richly upholstered furniture, valuable pictures and a great many other expensive articles were dropped in the snow in a helter-skelter manner. Although nearly every room in the hotel was occupied and rumors flew thick and fast that many of the guests were still in their rooms, fortunately no lives were lost and no one was injured. The coolest person in the building was a young man by the name of Pete O'Brien, the night watchman. When he heard of the fire he comprehended in a moment the danger of a panic among over two hundred people who were locked in sleep, unconscious of danger. He went from room to room and from floor to floor, telling them of the danger, but assuring them all that they had plenty of time to escape. He apparently took command of the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of battle. To his presence of mind and coolness many of the guests were indebted for their escape from a frightful death. The fire department worked hard and did good service. The city had no waterworks at that time, but relied for water entirely upon cisterns located in different parts of the city. When the cisterns became dry it was necessary to place the steamer at the river and pump water through over two thousand feet of hose. Among the guests at the hotel at the time of the fire were Gen. C.C. Andrews, Judge Lochren, Capt. H.A. Castle, Gen. W.G. Le Duc, Selah Chamberlain, Gov. Armstrong and wife, Charles A. Gilman and wife, Dr. W.W. Mayo, I.W. Webb, Dr. Charles N. Hewitt, M.H. Dunnell, Judge Thomas Wilson and more than two hundred others. The Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St. Peter street, was at one time one of of the swell hotels of the city. It was a frame building, four stories high and nicely situated. The proprietors of it intended it should be a family hotel, but it did not meet with the success anticipated, and when, on the 19th of May, 1878, it was burned to the ground it was unoccupied. The fire was thought to be the work of incendiaries. The loss was about $20,000, partially insured. Four firemen were quite seriously injured at this fire, but all recovered. The Carpenter house, on the corner of Summit avenue and Ramsey street, was built by Warren Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter was a man of colossal ideas, and from the picturesque location of his hotel, overlooking the city, he could see millions of tourists flocking to his hostelry. The panic of 1857, soon followed by the great Civil war, put a quietus on immigration, and left him stranded high on the beach. Mr. Carpenter's dream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th of January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some time previous passed beyond his control. At one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street. The average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever existed. The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota streets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city, and it was one of the last to be burned. The first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a thriving business.

The first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a thriving business. As the city grew it was made over into a large boarding house, and before the war Mrs. Corbett was manager of the place. It was afterward kept by Mrs. Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben Ferris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by fire. The building was burned In August, 1873. A hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house, situated on the corner of Fifth and St. Peter streets, the site of the Windsor hotel. It was a three-story frame structure and was built in the early seventies. Mr. Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and then sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was burned. The Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and that only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make room for the present building many years ago. Aside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that ever occurred at a fire in St. Paul took place in May, 1870, when the old Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed. Concert Hall was built by the late J.W. McClung in 1857, and the hall in the basement was one of the largest in the city. The building was three stories high in front and six or seven on the river side. It was located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk. Under the sidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from here that the fire was first noticed. In an incredibly short time flames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost impossible. On the river side of the building on the top floor two brothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop. The fire spread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames before they even thought their lives were endangered. In front of them was a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the river side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost certain death. They could be plainly seen frantically calling for help. There was no possible way to reach them. Finally Charles Mueller jumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant later he was followed by his brother. The bewildered spectators did not suppose for a moment that either could live. They were too much horrified to speak, but when it was over and they were lifted into beds provided for them doctors were called and recovery was pronounced possible. After months of suffering both recovered. August Mueller is still living in the city. A lady by the name of McClellan, who had a dressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death and it was several days before her body was recovered. The following named men have been chiefs of the St. Paul fire department:   Wash M. Stees,   Chas. H. Williams,   J.C.A. Pickett,   W.T. Donaldson,   J.B. Irvine,   J.E. Missen,   Luther H. Eddy,   B. Rodick,   M.B. Farrell,   J.C. Prendergast,   Bartlett Presley,   Frank Brewer,   R.O. Strong,   John T. Black,   Hart N. Cook,   John Jackson. THE FIRST AMUSEMENT HALLS IN ST. PAUL. INCIDENTS CONNECTED WITH THE EARLY AMUSEMENT HALLS OF ST. PAUL--IRVINE HALL--DAN EMMET AND DIXIE--THE HUTCHINSONS--MAZURKA HALL, MOZART HALL, ETC. Very few of the 200,000 inhabitants of St. Paul are aware that the three-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners once contained one of the most popular amusement halls in the city. It was called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall. Dan Emmet had a minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an excellent company it was, too. There was Frank Lombard, the great baritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat on the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and a large number of others. Frank Lombard afterward achieved a national reputation as one of the best baritone singers in the country. He was much sought after for patriotic entertainments and political conventions. His masterpiece was the Star-Spangled Banner, and his great baritone voice, which could be heard for blocks, always brought enthusiastic applause. Some time during the summer of 1858 the Hutchinson family arranged to have the hall for a one-night entertainment. By some means or other the troupe got separated and one of the brothers got stalled on Pig's Eye bar. When their performance was about half over the belated brother reached the hall and rushed frantically down the aisle, with carpetbag in hand, leaped upon the stage, and in full view of the audience proceeded to kiss the entire tribe. The audience was under the impression they had been separated for years instead of only twenty-four hours. The next evening Max Irwin was missing from his accustomed place as one of the end men, and when the performance had been in progress for about fifteen minutes Max came rushing down the aisle with carpetbag in hand and went through the same performance as did the lost brother of the Hutchinson family. The effect was electrical, and for some time Max's innovation was the talk of the town. Dan Emmet, though a wondering minstrel, was a very superior man and was his own worst", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-fec55d764089631728870dee42955975", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "hours.

The effect was electrical, and for some time Max's innovation was the talk of the town. Dan Emmet, though a wondering minstrel, was a very superior man and was his own worst enemy. He was a brother of Lafayette S. Emmett, chief justice of the supreme court of the State of Minnesota. The judge, dignified and aristocratic, did not take kindly to the idea of his brother being a minstrel. Dan was not particularly elated because his brother was on the supreme bench. They were wholly indifferent as to each other's welfare. They did not even spell their names the same way. Dan had only one \"t\" at the end of his name, while the judge used two. Whether the judge used two because he was ashamed of Dan, or whether Dan used only one because he was ashamed of the judge, no one seemed to know. Dan Emmet left a legacy that will be remembered by the lovers of melody for many years. What left the judge? When Emmet's company left St. Paul they got stranded and many of them found engagements in other organizations. Dan turned his attention to writing <DW64> melodies. He wrote several popular airs, one of them being \"Dixie,\" which afterward became the national air of the Confederate States. When \"Dixie\" was written Emmet was connected with Bryant's Minstrels in New York city, and he sent a copy to his friend in St. Paul, the late R.C. Munger, and asked his opinion as to its merits and whether he thought it advisable to place it in the hands of a publisher. Mr. Munger assured his friend that he thought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr. Emmet in placing it before the public. One of the first copies printed was sent to Mr. Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition was ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in the old concert hall building on Third street. \"Dixie\" at once became very popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in the country. Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he organized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States, starting from some point in Ohio in 1843. The father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and at one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of Ramsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished. A correspondent of one of the magazines gives the following account of how \"Dixie\" happened to become the national air of the Confederate States: \"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New Orleans. Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a march and war song for the grand chorus. A great many marches and songs were tried, but none could be decided upon until 'Dixie' was suggested and tried, and all were so enthusiastic over it that it was at once adopted and given in the performance. It was taken up immediately by the populace and was sung in the streets and in homes and concert halls daily. It was taken to the battlefields, and there became the great song of the South, and made many battles harder for the Northerner, many easier for the Southerner. Though it has particularly endeared itself to the South, the reunion of American hearts has made it a national song. Mr. Lincoln ever regarded it as a national property by capture.\" The Hutchinson family often visited St. Paul, the enterprising town of Hutchinson, McLeod county, being named after them. They were a very patriotic family and generally sang their own music. How deliberate the leader of the tribe would announce the title of the song about to be produced. Asa Hutchinson would stand up behind the melodeon, and with a pause between each word inform the audience that \"Sister--Abby--will--now--sing--the--beautiful--song--composed-- by--Lucy--Larcum--entitled--'Hannah--Is--at--the--Window--Binding-- Shoes.'\" And sister Abby would sing it, too. During the early part of the war the Hutchinson family was ordered out of the Army of the Potomac by Gen. McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments expressed in its songs. The general was apparently unable to interpret the handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the entire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the king of abolitionists--   \"John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave   And his soul is marching on.\" Gen. McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the entire American people. Before the war he was chief engineer of the Illinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St. Paul to see the future Mrs. McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj. R.B.

Rice homestead on Summit avenue. When Gen. McClellan was in command of the Army of the Potomac Maj. Marcy was his chief of staff. One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the following dispatch, published since the above was written: \"Chicago, Ill., Jan. 4, 1902.--John W. Hutchinson, the last survivor of the famous old concert-giving Hutchinson family, which was especially prominent in anti-bellum times, received many congratulations to-day on the occasion of his eighty-first birthday, Mr. Hutchinson enjoys good health and is about to start on a new singing and speaking crusade through the South, this time against the sale and us of cigarettes. Mr. Hutchinson made a few remarks to the friends who had called upon him, in the course of which he said: 'I never spent a more enjoyable birthday than this, except upon the occasion of my seventy-fifth, which I spent in New York and was tendered a reception by the American Temperance union, of which I was the organizer. Of course you will want me to sing to you, and I think I will sing my favorite song, which I wrote myself. It is \"The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.\" I have written a great many songs, among them \"The Blue and the Gray,\" \"Good old Days of Yore,\" and some others that I cannot remember now. I sang the \"Blue and the Gray\" in Atlanta six years ago, at the time of the exposition there, and McKinley was there. I had the pleasure of saying a few words at that time about woman's suffrage. I wrote the first song about woman's suffrage and called it \"Good Times for Women.\" This is the 11,667th concert which I have taken part in.'\" The venerable singer is reputed to be quite wealthy. A few years ago one of the children thought the old man was becoming entirely too liberal in the distribution of his wealth, and brought an action in the New York courts requesting the appointment of a guardian to his estate. The white-haired musician appeared in court without an attorney, and when the case was about to be disposed of made a request of the judge, which was granted, that he might be sworn. After Mr. Hutchinson had made his statement to the court the judge asked a few questions. \"How is your memory?\" said the judge. \"Memory,\" replied the old man. \"I remember the flavor of the milk at the maternal fountain.\" The judge concluded that Mr. Hutchinson was fully capable of managing his own affairs. Concert hall, built in 1857 by J.W. McClung, had room for 400 or 500 people, but it was somewhat inaccessible on account of its being in the basement of the building and was not very much in demand. Horatio Seymour made a great speech to the Douglas wing of the Democracy in the hall during the campaign of 1880, and Tom Marshall, the great Kentucky orator, delivered a lecture on Napoleon to a large audience In the same place. On the night of the presidential election in 1860 a number of musicians who had been practicing on \"Dixie\" and other music in Munger's music store came down to the hall and entertained the Republicans who had gathered there for the purpose of hearing the election returns. There was a great deal more singing than there was election returns, as about all the news they were able to get was from the four precincts of St. Paul, New Canada, Rose and Reserve townships and West St. Paul. We had a telegraph line, to be sure, but Mr. Winslow, who owned the line, would not permit the newspapers, or any one else, to obtain the faintest hint of how the election had gone in other localities. After singing until 11 or 12 o'clock, and abusing Mr. Winslow in language that the linotype is wholly unable to reproduce, the crowd dispersed. Nothing could be heard of how the election had gone until the following afternoon, when Gov. Ramsey received a dispatch from New York announcing that that state had given Mr. Lincoln 50,000 majority. As that was the pivotal state the Republicans immediately held a jollification meeting. Tom Marshall was one of the most eloquent orators America ever produced. He was spending the summer in Minnesota endeavoring to recover from the effects of an over-indulgence of Kentucky's great staple product, but the glorious climate of Minnesota did not seem to have the desired effect, as he seldom appeared on the street without presenting the appearance of having discovered in the North Star State an elixer fully as invigorating as any produced in the land where colonels, orators and moonshiners comprise the major portion of the population. One day as Marshall came sauntering down Third street he met a club of Little Giants marching to a Democratic gathering. They thought they would have a little sport at the expense of the distinguished orator from Kentucky, and they haulted immediately in front of him and demanded a speech. They knew that Mr. Marshall was a pronounced Whig and supported the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but as he was from a slave state they did not think he would say anything reflecting on the character of their cherished leader. Mr. Marshall stepped to the front of the sidewalk and held up his hand and said: \"Do you think Douglas will ever be president? He will not, as no man of his peculiar physique ever entered the sacred portals of the White House.\" He then proceeded to denounce Douglas and the Democratic party in language that was very edifying to the few Republicans who chanced to be present. The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper caper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward more particular in their choice of", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN04l7jGcCAHBr4kgkEjknkzm+4/2umYkraB6ldVRptsIqTR7rCEo32sTRVbYJUtRtG5Fj7vmO9/2+95uZiGDTZVFFKGGXJdkIInnEpqKk1dU4dnX7N/yen4HPppe5Mis2gn3iSsfHwkN4VzqSFsX7PCXuPFwRig6MJQskp5avx4eeuSaK4/WZmSyq8yXgrupO8x/AFKZKfebZhIbi39DegwAesfdyjfpJy1XlMeuXzZH32cFaHXuLfcE+lYcG/scpRI8Vy3OCXvUL0KIGtUYcYe6YKPaffJyaKRskP6rS29ILoGz/1P0vIl7PGdmF1/AkdJmPoV3gCrcejmc6vLn2RcRr4drgCpzHdugZYIkWieyUuuSPhJfKAPCZtBqsJ1YxdQrJm9QfoAJksUxNFFNsBvVdLc6RbjHAlrLNxktktd2PH7KnpTdBA7EDTYbfiDn2bfxNZqjFY2t3t8KBzFRhLc4g2jmnxLL1SptWl95ERXHnuSiHbCbBGFVmuqT/8FGOUka03uED7De2R1Cj1fAHfJNrCCh15LFdvIObbn2QMod6xC5Fqey55Cpje7IXNHNX1TFhpyOOb2VOoxNITsoKrhBvumukarxYH6H2Ixaqz1H/lDPmD7h14Cab4a7ks0CnBePZjiUoG28IEjww1dqscABMs5cYS6ksPeywhKHqgtlckr6a6WD/y/5W7FQTEparX4cuCDvRm+a0YBq7WOWU5YFdqAEfwmVan3beOtR2VXiMD1PNQjmKNgpgDyyjLlIbPm8R/x4qVHJUr/iZOwl/75kYSiPvSV9V7BtShGX7x9bS6gnscLFSi8OZzjdCs9JiuYuaVt+Gr4LdlaPIEnCLpeAUy9xwEyXW5SkVlV2gk1/hLJG+c6+MyFQ0V8gZMueYUnnkGwwK8GVmG3I5S3FcpMh+CXRTF/BB8RCYTlfYxwbD+BB5RY8Sp5BvWzYqDXt62UHl30rxxF6Qvv8JGMFRFMAOvTs0UT5FW5lb0knVJPegHMWDsmCB+iWZ4N0fmO2d8uemUKl9PfhRG2jZSj6UZqux6hKeGZetNtXc5p5Gt1Xy/fPJRO+1QF/sEXKjv45LpgTHKlQixoq9nrb0Q5ESJh0bUDR/qlLUTqsFLqB/zx0LtOEXTFMgOZIertPXR/XwNej3cD7iI/OkFk9Hxg6xXksUXNSPSisraQ/YXKLXNi5ULS4SJnN9Wk7lSxA27g4l40RURY10VlsOgBj/KiWJ3q6nSCaqzZzmvyPWgV3UXKKEPzpsqqwbb0AvtUnJ1cdCgo1Su8F1iPwntHa2jU3hXzO5+Xr6uP8Uagv/Qt6Ax+hiqi7Z4tjIlCgvuebEGXw5fltfZlPUfJAWKVSWKqv1MQiJDUyi/oQyWArUWmKB+JPynv0IyMWE1GkrkL+zrsBD0EH3ZtjDN0KHjIOn5YZyyRrGtMWsV6IKoYDb7Vis9RPmJXgdKaHDXOav42bS7xMb2Imwzbhtv6FqBizgsthy8Jz5CnPMCxiioK1b+4i7wrGs1d0BKpifpUe2A75PwAxPNbqlLhF89njcRQwUhgkNoYHqTf82zxbzZiVfWcXkgzyRxAu1w4EtzNehM6k/cNsQL29Xd/u/Rc/kKPrf0nh/PNBMW6hX4gDhhtWgTSabWUJZXXNfOSH41XrR4gvi4bVISwWqE9CFyC+2sa3kukCxVAMmgQ9Bpe4NH666EbpjSdffqKlSCpixvgSmRJ1Rc4LMq+0m94mMWO5dpr6nvE42SQ/c5bRN/5OWqSUHG/mi8BW+lb9PrTOeYd4VWxRdzuHOggx2r1gIG7nrmj0yMfApXp8yH48knfBJsIyZRbrEnrRX+tHEBmtQJty39Qo5nolizHHN8gHEO43wr9o7YDyazc+H96ylTI4jlvDCy3ANPE/141fhtyiKvutjidF8LjctIzmwFQSYJKY/+46pkr6rLdaOwW5iD5eEiqVD6iv5Q3ufLUS6Qk1osOUIs10VHVPk0dJRcWTwATfK2OIez03lauoGgC9sffrj1EWuajwJZ5nHRmoytx74I5ivv1W5gSz71VjgvxTy4R5UpM/CKbaH4LqWodzL6GQcMY3eszAmc4b1Ip0LD8NN0gVmNXc5sFAfgv6GB+Fx6jUzoa1E9w+epiP8CnoDfZyoJ4sVH/Bxqv8kNUedqbPhNb5mOjuD8i2DryuG8C7zkPBCEopmIUnl7FbfmkCsaJeNpn7COWU4LlJfob1KHL4m/CWd4N3lv2S8rEmU77qXVtHMWmYYugZ+B4rcz2A93axPAj1koX4WRyAXvk2eJxZwFeC58Tov2meZY2ofkQHbJem+nC7s8V1iT5g6Xf18qcymjHMoO3Ov/bL6SYh1llawaBR6wo/mfvbQYjpTbB7EdvA8nGDLRtH0HB2wMUKvvSL4JlyAGjwp7nbIa4zzjpiw76gQUz5XGEfV6ePYYooVFimKLTtUIOxGffxT9eDQecOS8bSMWCUbZNMTqOmqJdjOHE80oI22GmwLnaQytZ+U58xxZZ5na2CmaS3qJfbxp4TtBKtYqFflLfap9E5mC9EKayDi/6H0gRGCR8qD+yXescMWy15Sr3AO+rp9OWmITxDv7Z2mq8r/ARFhhJs="}, {"__id__": "chunk-436f34d0d58d1895c9ded9174e61873b", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "the sidewalk and held up his hand and said: \"Do you think Douglas will ever be president?

The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper caper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward more particular in their choice of an orator. One night there was a Democratic meeting in the hall and after a number of speakers had been called upon for an address, De Witt C. Cooley, who was a great wag, went around in the back part of the hall and called upon the unterrified to \"Holler for Cooley.\" The request was complied with and Mr. Cooley's name was soon on the lips of nearly the whole audience. When Mr. Cooley mounted the platform an Irishman in the back part of the hall inquired in a voice loud enough to be heard by the entire audience, \"Is that Cooley?\" Upon being assured that it was, he replied in a still louder voice: \"Be jabers, that's the man that told me to holler for Cooley.\" The laugh was decidedly on Cooley, and his attempted flight of oratory did not materialize. Cooley was at one time governor of the third house and if his message to that body could be reproduced it would make very interesting reading. The Athenaeum was constructed in 1859 by the German Reading society, and for a number of years was the only amusement hall in St. Paul with a stage and drop curtain. In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent a part of the summer in St. Paul, and local amusement lovers were delightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn. During the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were given at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue. The cantata of \"The Haymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a hit, and old residents will recollect Mrs. Winne, Mrs. Blakeley and Prof. Perkins, who took the leading parts. Prof. Phil Roher and Otto Dreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some time after the close of the war. Plunkett's Dramatic company, with Susan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time before the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street. During the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were brought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place. In 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was built, and it was one of the principal places of amusement. The Hough Dramatic company, with Bernard, C.W. Couldock, Sallie St. Clair and others were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers. In 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so proficient did the members become that many of them were enabled to take charge of squads, companies and even regiments in the great struggle that was soon to follow. In 1860 the Ingersoll block on Bridge Square was constructed, and as that was near the center of the city the hall on the third floor was liberally patronized for a number of years. Many distinguished speakers have entertained large and enthusiastic audiences from the platform of this popular hall. Edward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson and John B. Gough are among the great orators who have electrified and instructed the older inhabitants, and the musical notes of the Black Swan, Mlle. Whiting and Madame Varian will ever be remembered by those whose pleasure it was to listen to them. Mrs. Scott Siddons, an elocutionist of great ability and a descendant of the famous English family of actors of that name, gave several dramatic readings to her numerous admirers. When Sumter was fired on, Capt. W.H. Acker used this hall as a rendezvous and drill hall for Company C, First regiment of Minnesota volunteers, and many rousing war meetings for the purpose of devising ways and means for the furtherance of enlistments took place in this building. In February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of St. Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave a social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds for the establishment of a library. It was a sort of dedicatory opening of the building and hall, and was attended by large delegations from the different churches. Quite a large sum was realized. A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning of what is now the St. Paul library soon opened up to the public. About 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social, and the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per year for permission to read them. Dr. T.D. Simonton was the first librarian. Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St. Paul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than doubled. A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of reading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum. The People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in the city. H.

H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of entertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company. Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among the members. During the summer of 1858 Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Wallack came to St. Paul and played a two weeks' engagement. They were the most prominent actors who had yet appeared in this part of the country. \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Macbeth\" were on their repertoire. Probably \"Macbeth\" was never played to better advantage or to more appreciative audiences than it was during the stay of the Wallacks. Mrs. Wallack's Lady Macbeth was a piece of acting that few of the present generation can equal. Col. R.E.J. Miles was one of the stars at this theater, and it was at this place that he first produced the play of \"Mazeppa,\" which afterward made him famous. A.M. Carver, foreman of the job department of the St. Paul Times, often assisted in theatrical productions. Mr. Carver was not only a first-class printer, but he was also a very clever actor. His portrayal of the character of Uncle Tom in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which had quite a run, and was fully equal to any later production by full fledged members of the dramatic profession. Mr. Carver was one of the first presidents of the International Typographical union, and died in Cincinnati many years ago, leaving a memory that will ever be cherished by all members of the art preservative. This theater had a  gallery, and the shaded gentry were required to pay as much for admission to the gallery at the far end of the building as did the nabobs in the parquet. Joe Rolette, the member from \"Pembina\" county, occasionally entertained the audience at this theater by having epileptic fits, but Joe's friends always promptly removed him from the building and the performance would go on undisturbed. On the second story of an old frame building on the southeast corner of Third and Exchange streets there was a hall that was at one time the principal amusement hall of the city. The building was constructed in 1850 by the Elfelt brothers and the ground floor was occupied by them as a dry goods store. It is one of the very oldest buildings in the city. The name of Elfelt brothers until quite recently could be seen on the Exchange street side of the building. The hall was named Mazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s took place in this old building. At a ball given in the hall during one of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A. Ward, bookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter of one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance of about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got married. They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was known all over the town the next day and produced great commotion. Miss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they were finally divorced without having lived together. For a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in this building. Heitz had participated in a number of battles under the great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the graphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often relate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster stew. During the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large buildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel. Mozart hall was on the Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner. At a sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls were thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was held for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary commission. Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the principal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword to the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the front. A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities on this plan, and the name of Col. Marshall of the Seventh regiment and Col. Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it was thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a large vote. The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side had some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number of votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close to carry off the prize. Col. Uline had been a fireman and was very popular with the young men of the city. Col. Marshall was backed by friends in the different newspaper offices. The contest was very spirited and resulted in Col. Uline capturing the sword, he having received more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last five minutes the polls were open. This fair was very successful, the patriotic citizens of St. Paul having enriched the funds of the sanitary commission by several thousand dollars. One of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge Square, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall. Whether it was named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its beverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine. In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more pomp and glory than any holiday during the year. The Pioneer Guards, the City Guards, the St. Paul Light Artillery, the St. Paul fire department and numerous secret organizations would form in procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the nation's first", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9bf8943ee8dd238feb8fd1d1ea67c1d4", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "or the agonizing effects of its beverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine. In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more pomp and glory than any holiday during the year. The Pioneer Guards, the City Guards, the St. Paul Light Artillery, the St. Paul fire department and numerous secret organizations would form in procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the nation's first great hero would take place. Business was generally suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the following day. In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St. Paul for the first time. She was about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company. They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river towns. Their concert took place in the hall of the house of representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available place at the time. Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud by an incident that has never been printed. Two boys employed as messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations as it was possible for kids to conceive. After an hour or so of revelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated. In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall and an alarm of fire was sounded. The door leading to the house was forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned through the floor. The boys knew at once that it was their carelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids never got together. They could see visions of policemen, prison bars, and even Stillwater, day and night for many years. They would often get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they had yet been suspected. For more than a quarter of a century these two kids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts, and it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible predicament. A few days after Maj. Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and Stripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of party, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives for the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the dastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government. Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was packed and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of the building in order that all who desired might take part in the proceedings. Hon. John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided, assisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents. Hon. John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the principal speakers. Mr. Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for congress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested to hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict. It was very soon apparent that Mr. Gilman was in hearty sympathy with the object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great demonstrations of approbation. Hon. J.W. Taylor followed Mr. Gilman and made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr. Lincoln. There were a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted pledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling on the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly forming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid when necessary to the dependant families of those left behind. Similar meetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times before the Rebellion was subdued. The first Republican state convention after the state was admitted into the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives. The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time and Col. Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for representatives in congress. Col. Aldrich did not pretend to be much of an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while he was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his associates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and he promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to promote the success of the ticket. Aromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built in 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of the war. The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of the social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by the Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day. The Pioneer Guards disbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members were officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole away and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's staff during the entire war. Col. Wilkin Col. King, Col. Farrell, Capt. Coates, Capt. Van Slyke, Capt. Western, Lieut. Zernberg and Lieut. Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others followed as the war progressed.

Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others followed as the war progressed. It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St. Paul could boast of a genuine opera house. The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street, on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local talent. The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who paid $72 for a seat in the parquet. This man Philbrick was a visitor in St. Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him. It was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people were sure that he was at least a duke. He disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared. It was learned afterward that this mysterious person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark. The first regular company to occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily Melville as the chief attraction. This little theater could seat about 1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed. Wendell Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and many others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old opera house. An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was in St. Paul. Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before the lecture was to commence, and when Mr. Douglass commenced speaking there was standing room only. A couple of enthusiastic Republicans found standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in front of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of W.H. Shelley. Mr. Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in local Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous swing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to do was to swing around with him. Consequently the Republicans who stood up behind Mr. Shelley thought they would have a little amusement at his expense. Every time Mr. Douglass made a point worthy of applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great demonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could only see the huge outline of Mr. Shelley they concluded that he was thoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the Republican fold. Mr. Shelley stood it until the lecture was about half over, when he left the opera house in disgust. Mr. Shelley was a candidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St. Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson, but as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked confirmation. About the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England a number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the Athenaeum. There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at that time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as possible. James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the Benecia boy. They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all the attendants necessary for properly staging the melee. It was prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out. And Hill has kept right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries, and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty years ago.

Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, \"the man behind the gun,\" received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of our early history. In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in St. Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the new territory of Minnesota. Accompanying him were two young printers, named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the great Northwest. These two young men quickly tired of their isolation and returned to their former home. They were soon followed by another young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his country's honor. Capt. E.Y. Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa., on the 25th of September, 1827. When a mere lad he removed to Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to take part in the campaign against the Mexicans. He was assigned to the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of hostilities. On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered to report to Gen. Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras. As soon as Gen. Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the leadership of Santa Ana. Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa Ana withdrew from Gen. Taylor's front and retreated toward the City of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the American forces under the command of Gen. Scott. Peace was declared in 1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St. Louis, where they were mustered out of the service. Capt. Shelly took passage in a steamer for St. Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849, being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota. The Pioneer was the first paper printed in St. Paul, but the Register and Chronicle soon followed. Capt. Shelly's first engagement was in the office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was employed by Mr. Goodhue at the time of his tragic death. When Col. Robertson Started the Daily Democrat Capt. Shelly was connected with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat consolidated. Capt. Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's battalion. Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they were mustered into service in September, 1861. They were ordered to report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry. In February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and surrender of Fort Donelson. Brackett's battalion was the only Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.

Buckner from receiving reinforcements. After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them. From Fort Donelson three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being Capt. Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen. Beauregard, who was only a short distance away. Brackett's company was sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen. Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen. Grant. This timely precaution enabled Gen. Buell to arrive at Pittsburg Landing just in time to save Gen. Grant from probable defeat. For three months after this battle Capt. Shelly's company was engaged in protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth, Miss. On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief. This attack of the rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February, 1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort Donelson. They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt. Shelly were injured. Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle. They were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes. Opposed to them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry officers in the Confederate service. A number of severe actions ended in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a prominent part. After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept on duty on the dividing line between the two forces. About the 1st of January, 1864, most of Capt. Shelly's company reinlisted and they returned home on a thirty days' furlough. After receiving a number of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864, received orders to report to Gen. Sully at Sioux City, who was preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux. On the 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march over the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana. It encountered the Indians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way. About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and the members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored region. In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where they went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since leaving Fort Snelling. Capt. Shelly was mustered out of the service in the spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has been engaged at his old profession. Capt. Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many stirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it could well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that \"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country, he would not in his old age have forsaken him.\" Political preferment and self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye, while others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of their lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an ungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.

He enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four years, returning as first lieutenant. He now resides in Meadeville, Pa. Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both before and after the war. He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota cavalry. Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion were engaged in the real estate business. Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the war and foreman of the old St. Paul Press after the war. He enlisted during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier. No better soldier ever left the state. He was collector of customs of the port of St. Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press. The most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the United States, was the late Charles R. Stuart. He claimed to be a lineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart. For two years in succession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more type than any of his competitors. At an endurance test in New York he is reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in twenty-four hours. He was originally from Detroit. In the spring of 1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work. The Minnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one that day to help them out. Mr. Stuart was put to work and soon distributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he was going to do with it. After he had been at work a short time they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had distributed and probably more, too. When he pasted up the next morning the foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over and took a survey of Mr. Stuart, and then went back and measured it again. He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no one could discover anything wrong with it. The string measured 23,000 ems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in this section of the country. It was no uncommon occurrence for Mr. Stuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for the entire day. Mr. Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread all over the city in a short time and people used to come to the office to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to see the typesetting machine. In 1862 Mr. Stuart enlisted in the Eighth regiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant. For a number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which place he died about five years ago. He was not only a good printer, but a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything connected with the printing business. E.S. Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers. He served three years in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the Pioneer. M.J. Clum is one of the oldest printers in St. Paul. He was born in Rensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St. Paul in 1853. He learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late minister to Greece, and also with C.L. McArthur, editor of the Northern Budget. Mr. Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota, and took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion. J.B. Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the Union. At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St. Anthony Falls. During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who were attached to the First regiment. S J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days. In 1859 he went to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory. He was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion. For many years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last administration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska. M.R. Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business for some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth Minnesota during the rebellion. A.J. Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was connected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years. Robert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St. Paul offices at various times. He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley. William A. Hill came to St. Paul during the early '50s. He was a member of the Seventh Minnesota. Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in a hospital in Virginia. William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of sharpshooters in St. Paul, and they served throughout the war in the army of the Potomac. S. Teverbaugh and H.I. Vance were territorial printers, and were both in the army, but served in regiments outside the state.

S. Teverbaugh and H.I. Vance were territorial printers, and were both in the army, but served in regiments outside the state. There were a large number of other printers in the military service during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their names are not included in the above list. TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE. One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to Minnesota at an early day was Mr. James Mills. For a time he worked on the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the editorial department, where he remained for a number of years. After the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for a number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post. Among the numerous printers of St. Paul who were musically inclined no one was better known than the late O.G. Miller. He belonged to the Great Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the city for a number of years. Mr. Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and when he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic hall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city. George W. Moore came to St. Paul in 1850, and for a short time was foreman for Mr. Goodhue. In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P. Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian. He sold his interest in that paper to Dr. Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by President Lincoln collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Louis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen. When he first came to St. Paul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser. For a long time he was one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press. He was a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity. At one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket. Had it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been nominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor. George W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers. He wore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he always appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than most of his co-laborers. He was elected state treasurer on the democratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office devoted his attention to the real estate business. Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M. Culver. He was the first delegate from St. Paul to the International Typographical Union. Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect how strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when taking the third degree of that noble order. Who has not heard of David Ramaley? He is one of the best as well as one of the best known printers in the Northwest. He has been printer, reporter, editor, publisher and type founder. Although he has been constantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active and energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out the century mark. H.O. Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and cleanest compositers among the territorial printers. He was employed on the Minnesotian. Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the printing business--printer, reporter, editor. He was a most estimable man, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to his reward. The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years familiar to most old-time residents. At one time he was foreman of the old St. Paul Press. He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids Sentinel. The old St. Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard Bradley. He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held the same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years. D.L. Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled \"Who Stole Ben Johnson's Spaces.\" He was employed in several of the St. Paul offices previous to the rebellion. The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St. Paul. He formed a partnership with Col. Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian. For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St. Paul, and held several other positions of trust. J.B.H. Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum, publishers of the Daily Times. For several years after the war he was engaged as compositor in the St. Paul offices, and is now farming in Northern Minnesota. Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet printer by the name of Wentworth. He was called \"Long Haired Wentworth.\" Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment. When Col. Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut. Wentworth would not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was summarly dismissed from the service. After being ordered out of the regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other political prisoners. He never returned to Minnesota. Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the publication of the first paper at Glencoe. At one time he was a compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state printer for Nevada. Andrew Jackson Morgan was brought to St. Paul by the late Col", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-be8b49c919bf06f613da48187833e98b", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "the service. After being ordered out of the regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other political prisoners. He never returned to Minnesota. Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the publication of the first paper at Glencoe. At one time he was a compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state printer for Nevada. Andrew Jackson Morgan was brought to St. Paul by the late Col. D.A. Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat. He was a printer-politician and possessed considerable ability. At one time he was one of the editors of the Democrat. He was said to bear a striking resemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with any one without informing them of the fact. He was one of the original Jacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar, which he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was christened. No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume on one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver dollar. He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that the immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity. Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column was J.Q.A. Ward, commonly known as Jack Ward. He was business manager of the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper. The first immigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product of Jack's ingenuity. Jack created quite a sensation at one time by marrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room acquaintance. He was a very bright man and should have been one of the foremost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was his own worst enemy. Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour. His theory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business it was always better to give up the business. A.M. Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he was also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity. It was no uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to be printers. Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent actors were knights of the stick and rule. Frequently during the happy distribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist and the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would receive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled in a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat, but modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will receive their diplomas from the composing room. Since the introduction of the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the sociability that once existed in the composing room will be known hereafter only to tradition. The late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old Pioneer composing room. He was well posted on all topics and was always ready to take either side of a question for the sake of argument. Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that would have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would talk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often surprised and always entertained the weary distributors. At one time Jebb was reporter on the St. Paul Times. Raising blooded chickens was one of his hobbies. One night some one entered his premises and appropriated, a number of his pet fowls. The next day the Times had a long account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article he hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant. It was a fatal bull and was Mr. Jebb's reportorial finish. A fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous biography of Washington. The editor of the paper on which he was employed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate appearance. To make the matter more offensive the author on several different occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship to the editor who was compelled to apologize for it. In two different articles on nationalities by two different young printer reporters, one referred to the Germans as \"the beer-guzzling Dutch,\" and the other, speaking of the English said \"thank the Lord we have but few of them in our midst,\" caused the writers to be promptly relegated back to the case. Bishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times. A short conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he wasn't really a bishop. In an account of confirming a number of people at Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said \"Bishop Willoughby administered the rite of confirmation,\" when he should have said Bishop Whipple. He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder that he at once tendered his resignation. Of course it was not accepted. Editors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated than they are to-day. Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for economical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same room. All the offices contained blankets and cots, and as morning newspapers were only morning newspapers in name, the tired and weary printer could sleep the sleep of the just without fear of disturbance.

When the old Press removed from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner of Third and Minnesota streets, Earle S. Goodrich came up into the composing room and requested the privilege of setting the first type in the new building. He was provided with a stick and rule and set up about half a column of editorial without copy. The editor of the Press, in commenting on his article, said it was set up as \"clean as the blotless pages of Shakespeare.\" In looking over the article the next morning some of the typos discovered an error in the first line. THE DECISIVE BATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS. THE FIRST BATTLE DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNION FORCES SCORED A DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE REBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED. Every Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made of the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion. At the outbreak of the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so intensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments volunteered at the first call of the president. As only ten companies could go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for a second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming. On the 16th of June, 1861, Gov. Ramsey received notice that a second regiment would be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized with two or three additions made up the famous Second Minnesota. H.P. Van Cleve was appointed colonel, with headquarters at Fort Snelling. Several of the companies were sent to the frontier to relieve detachments of regulars stationed at various posts, but on the 16th of October, 1861, the full regiment started for Washington. On reaching Pittsburgh, however, their destination was changed to Louisville, at which place they were ordered to report to Gen. W.T. Sherman, then in command of the Department of the Cumberland, and they at once received orders to proceed to Lebanon Junction, about thirty miles south of Louisville. The regiment remained at this camp about six weeks before anything occurred to relieve the monotony of camp life, although there were numerous rumors of night attacks by large bodies of Confederates. On the 15th of November, 1861, Gen. Buell assumed command of all the volunteers in the vicinity of Louisville, and he at once organized them into divisions and brigades. Early in December the Second regiment moved to Lebanon, Ky., and, en route, the train was fired at. At Lebanon the Second Minnesota, Eighteenth United States infantry, Ninth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments were organized into a brigade, and formed part of Gen. George H. Thomas' First division. On Jan. 1, 1862, Gen. Thomas started his troops on the Mill Springs campaign and from the 1st to the 17th day of January, spent most of its time marching under rain, sleet and through mud, and on the latter date went into camp near Logan's Cross Roads, eight miles north of Zollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove. On the night of Jan. 18, Company A was on picket duty. It had been raining incessantly and was so dark that it was with difficulty that pickets could be relieved. Just at daybreak the rebel advance struck the pickets of the Union lines, and several musket shots rang out with great distinctness, and in quick succession, it being the first rebel shot that the boys had ever heard. Then all was quiet for a time. The firing soon commenced again, nearer and more distinct than at first, and thicker and faster as the rebel advance encountered the Union pickets. The Second Minnesota had entered the woods and passing through the Tenth Indiana, then out of ammunition and retiring and no longer firing. The enemy, emboldened by the cessation and mistaking its cause, assumed they had the Yanks on the run, advanced to the rail fence separating the woods from the field just as the Second Minnesota was doing the same, and while the rebels got there first, they were also first to get away and make a run to their rear. But before they ran their firing was resumed and Minnesotians got busy and the Fifteenth Mississippi and the Sixteenth Alabama regiments were made to feel that they had run up against something. To the right of the Second were two of Kinney's cannon and to their right was the Ninth Ohio. The mist and smoke which hung closely was too thick to see through, but by lying down it was possible to look under the smoke and to see the first rebel line, and that it was in bad shape, and back of it and down on the low ground a second line, with their third line on the high ground on the further side of the field. That the Second Minnesota was in close contact with the enemy was evident all along its line, blasts of fire and belching smoke coming across the fence from Mississippi muskets. The contest was at times hand to hand--the Second Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence, firing and using the bayonet when opportunity offered. The firing was very brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that the enemy had disappeared. The battle was over, the Johnnies had \"skedaddled,\" leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field. Many of the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered.

The firing was very brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that the enemy had disappeared. The battle was over, the Johnnies had \"skedaddled,\" leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field. Many of the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered. After the firing had ceased one rebel lieutenant bravely stood in front of the Second and calmly faced his fate. After being called on to surrender he made no reply, but deliberately raised his hand and shot Lieut. Stout through the body. He was instantly shot. His name proved to be Bailie Peyton, son of one of the most prominent Union men in Tennessee. Gen. Zollicoffer, commander of the Confederate forces, was also killed in this battle. This battle, although a mere skirmish when compared to many other engagements in which the Second participated before the close of the war, was watched with great interest by the people of St. Paul. Two full companies had been recruited in the city and there was quite a number of St. Paulites in other companies of this regiment. When it became known that a battle had been fought in which the Second had been active participants, the relatives and friends of the men engaged in the struggle thronged the newspaper offices in quest of information regarding their safety. The casualties in the Second Minnesota, amounted to twelve killed and thirty-five wounded. Two or three days after the battle letters were received from different members of the Second, claiming that they had shot Bailie Payton and Zollicoffer. It afterward was learned that no one ever knew who shot Peyton, and that Col. Fry of the Fourth Kentucky shot Zollicoffer. Lieut. Tuttle captured Peyton's sword and still has it in his possession. This sword has a historic record. It was presented to Bailie Peyton by the citizens of New Orleans at the outbreak of the Mexican war, and was carried by Col. Peyton during the entire war. Col. Peyton was on Gen. Scott's staff at the close of the war, and when Santa Anna surrendered the City of Mexico to Gen. Scott, Col. Peyton was the staff officer designated by Scott to receive the surrender of the city, carrying this sword by his side. It bears this inscription: \"Presented to Col. Bailie Peyton, Fifth Regiment Louisiana Volunteer National Guards, by his friends of New Orleans. His country required his services. His deeds will add glory to her arms.\" There has been considerable correspondence between the government and state, officials and the descendants of Col. Peyton relative to returning this trophy to Col. Peyton's relatives, but so far no arrangements to that effect have been concluded. It was reported by Tennesseeans at the time of the battle that young Peyton was what was known as a \"hoop-skirt\" convert to the Confederate cause. Southern ladies were decidedly more pronounced secessionists than were the sterner sex, and whenever they discovered that one of their chivalric brethren was a little lukewarm toward the cause of the South they sent him a hoop skirt, which indicated that the recipient was lacking in bravery. For telling of his loyalty to the Union he was insulted and hissed at on the streets of Nashville, and when he received a hoop skirt from his lady friends he reluctantly concluded to take up arms against the country he loved so well. He paid the penalty of foolhardy recklessness in the first battle in which he participated. A correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial, who was an eye-witness of the battle, gave a glowing description of the heroic conduct of the Second Minnesota during the engagement. He said: \"The success of the battle was when the Second Minnesota and the Ninth Ohio appeared in good order sweeping through the field. The Second Minnesota, from its position in the column, was almost in the center of the fight, and in the heaviest of the enemy's fire. They were the first troops that used the bayonet, and the style with which they went into the fight is the theme of enthusiastic comment throughout the army.\" It was the boast of Confederate leaders at the outbreak of the rebellion that one regiment of Johnnies was equal to two or more regiments of Yankees. After the battle of Mill Springs they had occasion to revise their ideas regarding the fighting qualities of the detested Yankees. From official reports of both sides, gathered after the engagement was over, it was shown that the Confederate forces outnumbered their Northern adversaries nearly three to one. The victory proved a dominant factor in breaking up the Confederate right flank, and opened a way into East Tennessee, and by transferring the Union troops to a point from which to menace Nashville made the withdrawal of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green, Ky., to Nashville necessary. Confederate loss, 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners. Union loss, 248 in killed and wounded. Twelve rebel cannon and caissons complete were captured. Two hundred wagons with horses in harness were captured, as were large quantities of ammunition, store and camp equipments--in fact, the Union troops took all there was. Col. Fry's version of the killing of Zollicoffer is as follows: While on the border of \"old fields\" a stranger in citizen clothes rode up by his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder, and said: \"Don't let us be firing on our own men. Those are our men,\" pointing at the same time toward our forces. Col. Fry looked upon him inquiringly a moment, supposing him to be one of his own men, after which he rode forward not more than fifteen paces, when an officer came dashing up, first recognizing the stranger and almost the same instant firing upon Col", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-074a1e4bc4fa465f80f20624b8ddeb17", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "by his side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder, and said: \"Don't let us be firing on our own men.

Fry. At the same moment the stranger wheeled his horse, facing Col. Fry, when the colonel shot him in the breast. Gen. Zollicoffer was a prominent and influential citizen of Nashville previous to the war, and stumped the state with Col. Peyton in opposition to the ordinance of secession, but when Tennessee seceded he determined to follow the fortunes of his state. The day before the battle Gen. Zollicoffer made a speech to his troops in which he said he would take them to Indiana or go to hell himself. He didn't go to Indiana. The poet of the Fourth Kentucky perpetrated the following shortly after the battle:   \"Old Zollicoffer is dead   And the last word he said:   I see a wild cat coming.   Up steps Col. Fry.   And he hit him in the eye   And he sent him to the happy land of Canaan.   Ho! boys, ho!   For the Union go!   Hip hurrah for the happy land of freedom.\" The loyal Kentuckians were in great glee and rejoiced over the victory. It was their battle against rebel invaders from Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, who were first met by their own troops of Wolford's First cavalry and the Fourth Kentucky infantry, whose blood was the first to be shed in defense of the Stars and Stripes; and their gratitude went out to their neighbors from Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio who came to their support and drove the invaders out of their state. On Feb. 24, 1862, the Second Minnesota was again in Louisville, where the regiment had admirers and warm friends in the loyal ladies, who as evidence of their high appreciation, though the mayor of the city, Hon. J.M. Dolph, presented to the Second regiment a silk flag. The mayor said. \"Each regiment is equally entitled to like honor, but the gallant conduct of those who came from a distant state to unite in subduing our rebel invaders excites the warmest emotions of our hearts.\" On Jan. 25 President Lincoln's congratulations were read to the regiment, and on Feb. 9, at Waitsboro, Ky., the following joint resolution of the Minnesota legislature was read before the regiment: Whereas, the noble part borne by the First regiment, Minnesota infantry, in the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, Va., is yet fresh in our minds; and, whereas, we have heard with equal satisfaction the intelligence of the heroism displayed by the Second Minnesota infantry in the late brilliant action at Mill Springs, Ky.: Therefore be it resolved by the legislature of Minnesota, That while it was the fortune of the veteran First regiment to shed luster upon defeat, it was reserved for the glorious Second regiment to add victory to glory. Resolved, that the bravery of our noble sons, heroes whether in defeat or victory, is a source of pride to the state that sent them forth, and will never fail to secure to them the honor and the homage of the government and the people. Resolved, That we sympathize with the friends of our slain soldiers, claiming as well to share their grief as to participate in the renown which the virtues and valor of the dead have conferred on our arms. Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, having the signature of the executive and the great seal of the state, be immediately forwarded by the governor to the colonels severally in command of the regiments, to be by them communicated to their soldiers at dress parade. The battle at Mill Springs was the first important victory achieved by the Union army in the Southwest after the outbreak of the rebellion, and the result of that engagement occasioned great rejoicing throughout the loyal North. Although the battle was fought forty-five years ago, quite a number of men engaged in that historic event are still living in St. Paul, a number of them actively engaged in business. Among the number are J.W. Bishop, J.C. Donahower, M.C. Tuttle, R.A. Lanpher, M.J. Clum, William Bircher, Robert G. Rhodes, John H. Gibbons, William Wagner, Joseph Burger, Jacob J. Miller, Christian Dehn, William Kemper, Jacob Bernard, Charles F. Myer, Phillip Potts and Fred Dohm. THE GREAT BATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST SANGUINARY BATTLES OF THE CIVIL WAR--TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE--GALLANT ACTION OF THE FIRST MINNESOTA BATTERY--DEATH OF CAPT. W.H. ACKER. The battle of Pittsburg Landing on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, was one of the most terrific of the many great battles of the great Civil war. It has been likened to the battle of Waterloo. Napoleon sought to destroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with Blucher. Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of the Tennessee, under Gen. Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland, under Buell, could come to his assistance. At the second battle of Bull Run Gen. Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns, yet he remained inactive. At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by military men that Gen.

Napoleon sought to destroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with Blucher. Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of the Tennessee, under Gen. Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland, under Buell, could come to his assistance. At the second battle of Bull Run Gen. Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns, yet he remained inactive. At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by military men that Gen. Buell could have made a junction with Grant twenty-four hours sooner and thereby saved a terrible loss of life had he chosen to do so. Both generals were subsequently suspended from their commands and charges of disloyalty were made against them by many newspapers in the North. Gen. Porter was tried by court-martial and dismissed from the service. Many years after this decision was revoked by congress and the stigma of disloyalty removed from his name. Gen. Buell was tried by court-martial, but the findings of the court were never made public. Gen. Grant did not think Gen. Buell was guilty of the charges against him, and when he became commander-in-chief of the army in 1864 endeavored to have him restored to his command, but the war department did not seem inclined to do so. About two weeks before the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Grant was suspended from the command of the Army of the Tennessee by Gen. Halleck, but owing to some delay in the transmission of the order, an order came from headquarters restoring him to his command before he knew that he had been suspended. Gen. Grant's success at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous of his popularity. He was ordered arrested by Gen. McClellan, but the order was held up by the war department until Gen. Grant could be heard from. The reason for his arrest was that he went to Nashville to consult with Buell without permission of the commanding general. Dispatches sent to Grant for information concerning his command was never delivered to him, but were delivered over to the rebel authorities by a rebel telegraph operator, who shortly afterward joined the Confederate forces. Many years after the war Gen. Badeau, one of Grant's staff officers, was in search of information for his \"History of Grant's Military Campaigns,\" and he unearthed in the archives of the war department the full correspondence between Halleck, McClellan and the secretary of war, and it was not until then that Gen. Grant learned the full extent of the absurd accusations made against him. After the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Halleck assumed personal command of all the forces at that point and Gen. Grant was placed second in command, which meant that he had no command at all. This was very distasteful to Gen. Grant and he would have resigned his commission and returned to St. Louis but for the interposition of his friend, Gen. W.T. Sherman. Gen. Grant had packed up his belongings and was about to depart when Gen. Sherman met him at his tent and persuaded him to refrain. In a short time Halleck was ordered to Washington and Grant was made commander of the Department of West Tennessee, with headquarters at Memphis. Gen. Grant's subsequent career proved the wisdom of Sherman's entreaty. When Gen. Halleck assumed command he constructed magnificent fortifications, and they were a splendid monument to his engineering skill, but they were never occupied. He was like the celebrated king of France, who \"with one hundred thousand men, marched up the hill and then down again.\" Gen. Halleck had under his immediate command more than one hundred thousand well equipped men, and the people of the North looked to him to administer a crushing blow to the then retreating enemy. The hour had arrived--the man had not. \"Flushed with the victory of Forts Henry and Donelson,\" said the envious Halleck in a dispatch to the war department, previous to the battle, \"the army under Grant at Pittsburg Landing was more demoralized than the Army of the Potomac after the disastrous defeat of Bull Run.\" Soon after the battle the venerable Gen. Scott predicted that the war would soon be ended--that thereafter there would be nothing but guerrilla warfare at interior points. Gen. Grant himself in his memoirs says that had the victory at Pittsburg Landing been followed up and the army been kept intact the battles at Stone River, Chattanooga and Chickamauga would not have been necessary. Probably the battle of Pittsburg Landing was the most misunderstood and most misrepresented of any battle occurring during the war. It was charged that Grant was drunk; that he was far away from the battleground when the attack was made, and was wholly unprepared to meet the terrible onslaught of the enemy in the earlier stages of the encounter. Gen. Beauregard is said to have stated on the morning of the battle that before sundown he would water his horses in the Tennessee river or in hell. That the rebels did not succeed in reaching the Tennessee was not from lack of dash and daring on their part, but was on account of the sturdy resistance and heroism of their adversaries. According to Gen. Grant's own account of the battle, though suffering intense pain from a sprained ankle, he was in the saddle from early morning till late at night, riding from division to division, giving directions to their commanding officers regarding the many changes in the disposition of their forces rendered necessary by the progress of the battle.

The firm resistance made by the force under his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the charges made against him. Misunderstanding of orders, want of co-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of recruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter of the Union forces on the first day of the battle. The battle of Pittsburg Landing is sometimes called the battle of Shiloh, some of the hardest lighting having been done in the vicinity of an old log church called the Church of Shiloh, about three miles from the landing. The battle ground traversed by the opposing forces occupied a semi-circle of about three and a half miles from the town of Pittsburg, the Union forces being stationed in the form of a semi-circle, the right resting on a point north of Crump's Landing, the center being directly in front of the road to Corinth, and the left extending to the river in the direction of Harrisburg--a small place north of Pittsburg Landing. At about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, Col. Peabody of Prentiss' division, fearing that everything was not right, dispatched a body of 400 men beyond the camp for the purpose of looking after any body of men which might be lurking in that direction. This step was wisely taken, for a half a mile advance showed a heavy force approaching, who fired upon them with great slaughter. This force taken by surprise, was compelled to retreat, which they did in good order under a galling fire. At 6 o'clock the fire had become general along the entire front, the enemy having driven in the pickets of Gen. Sherman's division and had fallen with vengeance upon three Ohio regiments of raw recruits, who knew nothing of the approach of the enemy until they were within their midst. The slaughter on the first approach of the enemy was very severe, scores falling at every discharge of rebel guns. It soon became apparent that the rebel forces were approaching in overwhelming numbers and there was nothing left for them to do but retreat, which was done with considerable disorder, both officers and men losing every particle of their baggage, which fell into rebel hands. At 8:30 o'clock the fight had become general, the second line of divisions having received the advance in good order and made every preparation for a suitable reception of the foe. At this time many thousand stragglers, many of whom had never before heard the sound of musketry, turned their backs to the enemy, and neither threats or persuasion could induce them to turn back. The timely arrival of Gen. Grant, who had hastened up from Savannah, led to the adoption of measures that put a stop to this uncalled-for flight from the battle ground. A strong guard was placed across the thoroughfare, with orders to hault every soldier whose face was turned toward the river, and thus a general stampede was prevented. At 10 o'clock the entire line on both sides was engaged in one of the most terrible battles ever known in this country. The roar of the cannon and musketry was without intermission from the main center to a point extending halfway down the left wing. The great struggle was most upon the forces which had fallen back on Sherman's position. By 11 o'clock quite a number of the commanders of regiments had fallen, and in some instances not a single field officer remained; yet the fighting continued with an earnestness that plainly showed that the contest on both sides was for death or victory. The almost deafening sound of artillery and the rattle of musketry was all that could be heard as the men stood silently and delivered their fire, evidently bent on the work of destruction which knew no bounds. Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow strip of open land dividing the opponents. Many who were maimed fell back without help, while others still fought in the ranks until they were actually forced back by their company officers. Finding it impossible to drive back the center of our column, at 12 o'clock the enemy slackened fire upon it and made a most vigorous effort on our left wing, endeavoring to drive it to the river bank at a point about a mile and a half above Pittsburg Landing. With the demonstration of the enemy upon the left wing it was soon seen that all their fury was being poured out upon it, with a determination that it should give way. For about two hours a sheet of fire blazed both columns, the rattle of musketry making a most deafening noise. For about an hour it was feared that the enemy would succeed in driving our forces to the river bank, the rebels at times being plainly seen by those on the main landing below. While the conflict raged the hottest in this quarter the gunboat Tyler passed slowly up the river to a point directly opposite the enemy and poured in a broadside from her immense guns. The shells went tearing and crashing through the woods, felling trees in their course and spreading havoc wherever they fell. The explosions were fearful, the shells falling far inland, and they struck terror to the rebel force. Foiled in this attempt, they now made another attack on the center and fought like tigers. They found our lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming. Every man was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite conclusion. In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements, under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the battle ground. They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel. Volley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was re-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-02b249095455416ac52a060862c213f2", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ". Every man was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite conclusion. In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements, under Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every effort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the battle ground. They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel. Volley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was re-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both sides. At 5 o'clock there was a short cessation in the firing of the enemy, their lines falling back on the center for about half a mile. They again wheeled and suddenly threw their entire force upon the left wing, determined to make the final struggle of the day in that quarter. The gunboat Lexington in the meantime had arrived from Savannah, and after sending a message to Gen. Grant to ascertain in which direction the enemy was from the river, the Lexington and Tyler took a position about half a mile above the river landing, and poured their shells up a deep ravine reaching to the river on the right. Their shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect. In the meantime Gen. Lew Wallace, who had taken a circuitous route from Crump's Landing, appeared suddenly on the left wing of the rebels. In face of this combination the enemy felt that their bold effort was for the day a failure and as night was about at hand, they slowly fell back, fighting as they went, until they reached an advantageous position, somewhat in the rear, yet occupying the main road to Corinth. The gunboats continued to send their shells after them until they were far beyond reach. This ended the engagement for the day. Throughout the day the rebels evidently had fought with the Napoleonic idea of massing their entire force on weak points of the enemy, with the intention of braking through their lines, creating a panic and cutting off retreat. The first day's battle, though resulting in a terrible loss of Union troops, was in reality a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders. They fully expected, with their overwhelming force to annihilate Grant's army, cross the Tennessee river and administer the same punishment to Buell, and then march on through Tennessee, Kentucky and into Ohio. They had conceived a very bold movement, but utterly failed to execute it. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate forces, was killed in the first day's battle, being shot while attempting to induce a brigade of unwilling Confederates to make a charge on the enemy. Gen. Buell was at Columbia, Tenn., on the 19th of March with a veteran force of 40,000 men, and it required nineteen days for him to reach the Tennessee river, eighty-five miles distant, marching less than five miles a day, notwithstanding the fact that he had been ordered to make a junction with Grant's forces as soon as possible, and was well informed of the urgency of the situation. During the night steamers were engaged in carrying the troops of Nelson's division across the river. As soon as the boats reached the shore the troops immediately left, and, without music, took their way to the advance of the left wing of the Union forces. They had come up double quick from Savannah, and as they were regarded as veterans, the greatest confidence was soon manifest as to the successful termination of the battle. With the first hours of daylight it was evident that the enemy had also been strongly reinforced, for, notwithstanding they must have known of the arrival of new Union troops, they were first to open the ball, which they did with considerable alacrity. The attacks that began came from the main Corinth road, a point to which they seemed strongly attached, and which at no time did they leave unprotected. Within half an hour from the first firing in the morning the contest then again spread in either direction, and both the main and left wings were not so anxious to fight their way to the river bank as on the previous day, having a slight experience of what they might expect if again brought under the powerful guns of the Tyler and Lexington. They were not, however, lacking in activity, and they were met by our reinforced troops with an energy that they did not anticipate. At 9 o'clock the sound of the artillery and musketry fully equaled that of the day before. It now became evident that the rebels were avoiding our extreme left wing, and were endeavoring to find a weak point in our line by which they could turn our force and thus create a panic. They left one point but to return to it immediately, and then as suddenly would direct an assault upon a division where they imagined they would not be expected. The fire of the united forces was as steady as clockwork, and it soon became evident that the enemy considered the task they had undertaken a hopeless one. Notwithstanding continued repulses, the rebels up to 11 o'clock had given no evidence of retiring from the field. Their firing had been as rapid and vigorous at times as during the most terrible hours of the previous day. Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson and Crittenden were present everywhere directing the movements on our part for a new strike against the foe. Gen. Lew Wallace's division on the right had been strongly reinforced, and suddenly both wings of our army were turned upon the enemy, with the intention of driving the immense body into an extensive ravine. At the same time a powerful battery had been stationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into the rebel ranks and with the most telling effect.

At 11:30 o'clock the roar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being fired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory inspired. The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began to evince a desire to withdraw. They fought as they slowly moved back, keeping up their fire from their artillery and musketry, apparently disclaiming any notion that they thought of retreating. As they retreated they went in excellent order, halting at every advantageous point and delivering their fire with considerable effect. At noon it was settled beyond dispute that the rebels were retreating. They were making but little fire, and were heading their center column for Corinth. From all divisions of our lines they were closely pursued, a galling fire being kept up on their rear, which they returned at intervals with little or no effect. From Sunday morning until Monday noon not less than three thousand cavalry had remained seated In their saddles on the hilltop overlooking the river, patiently awaiting the time when an order should come for them to pursue the flying enemy. That time had now arrived and a courier from Gen. Grant had scarcely delivered his message before the entire body was in motion. The wild tumult of the excited riders presented a picture seldom witnessed on a battlefield. Gen. Grant himself led the charge. Gen. Grant, in his memoirs, summarizes the results of the two days' fighting as follows: \"I rode forward several miles the day of the battle and found that the enemy had dropped nearly all of their provisions and other luggage in order to enable them to get off with their guns. An immediate pursuit would have resulted in the capture of a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns....\" The effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the 6th was 33,000 men. Lew Wallace brought 5,000 more after nightfall. Beauregard reported the rebel strength at 40,955. Excluding the troops who fled, there was not with us at any time during the day more than 25,000 men in line. Our loss in the two days' fighting was 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded and 2,885 missing. Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699, of whom 1,728 were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing. On the first day of the battle Gen. Prentiss, during a change of position of the Union forces, became detached from the rest of the troops, and was taken prisoner, together with 2,200 of his men. Gen. W.H.L. Wallace, division commander, was killed in the early part of the struggle. The hardest fighting during the first day was done in front of the divisions of Sherman and McClernand. \"A casualty to Sherman,\" says Gen. Grant, \"that would have taken him from the field that day would have been a sad one for the Union troops engaged at Shiloh. And how near we came to this! On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the hand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a slight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat. In addition to this he had several horses shot during the day.\" During the second day of the battle Gen. Grant, Col. McPherson and Maj. Hawkins got beyond the left of our troops. There did not appear to be an enemy in sight, but suddenly a battery opened on them from the edge of the woods. They made a hasty retreat and when they were at a safe distance halted to take an account of the damage. In a few moments Col. McPherson's horse dropped dead, having been shot just back of the saddle. A ball had passed through Maj. Hawkins' hat and a ball had struck the metal of Gen. Grant's sword, breaking it nearly off. On the first day of the battle about 6,000 fresh recruits who had never before heard the sound of musketry, fled on the approach of the enemy. They hid themselves on the river bank behind the bluff, and neither command nor persuasion could induce them to move. When Gen. Buell discovered them on his arrival he threatened to fire on them, but it had no effect. Gen. Grant says that afterward those same men proved to be some of the best soldiers in the service. Gen. Grant, in his report, says he was prepared with the reinforcements of Gen. Lew Wallace's division of 5,000 men to assume the offensive on the second day of the battle, and thought he could have driven the rebels back to their fortified position at Corinth without the aid of Buell's army. At banquet hall, regimental reunion or campfire, whenever mention is made of the glorious record of Minnesota volunteers in the great Civil war, seldom, if ever, is the First Minnesota battery given credit for its share in the long struggle. Probably very few of the present residents of Minnesota are aware that such an organization existed. This battery was one of the finest organizations that left the state during the great crisis. It was in the terrible battle of Pittsburg Landing, the siege of Vicksburg, in front of Atlanta and in the great march from Atlanta to the sea, and in every position in which they were placed they not only covered themselves with glory, but they were an honor and credit to the state that sent them. The First Minnesota battery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall of 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain. Shortly after being mustered in they were ordered to St. Louis, where they received their accoutrements, and from there", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-35fcfac76ba65831deb07fd3f5b55dac", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "and in the great march from Atlanta to the sea, and in every position in which they were placed they not only covered themselves with glory, but they were an honor and credit to the state that sent them. The First Minnesota battery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall of 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain. Shortly after being mustered in they were ordered to St. Louis, where they received their accoutrements, and from there they were ordered to Pittsburg Landing, arriving at the latter place late in February, 1862. The day before the battle, they were transferred to Prentiss' division of Grant's army. On Sunday morning, April 6, the battery was brought out bright and early, preparing for inspection. About 7 o'clock great commotion was heard at headquarters, and the battery was ordered to be ready to march at a moment's notice. In about ten minutes they were ordered to the front, the rebels having opened fire on the Union forces. In a very short time rebel bullets commenced to come thick and fast, and one of their number was killed and three others wounded. It soon became evident that the rebels were in great force in front of the battery, and orders were issued for them to choose another position. At about 11 o'clock the battery formed in a new position on an elevated piece of ground, and whenever the rebels undertook to cross the field in front of them the artillery raked them down with frightful slaughter. Several times the rebels placed batteries In the timber at the farther end of the field, but in each instance the guns of the First battery dislodged them before they could get into position. For hours the rebels vainly endeavored to break the lines of the Union forces, but in every instance they were repulsed with frightful loss, the canister mowing them down at close range. About 5 o'clock the rebels succeeded in flanking Gen. Prentiss and took part of his force prisoners. The battery was immediately withdrawn to an elevation near the Tennessee river, and it was not long before firing again commenced and kept up for half an hour, the ground fairly shaking from the continuous firing on both sides of the line. At about 6 o'clock the firing ceased, and the rebels withdrew to a safe distance from the landing. The casualties of the day were three killed and six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward. The fight at what was known as the \"hornet's nest\" was most terrific, and had not the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels would have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a point dangerously near the Tennessee river. Capt. Munch's horse received a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself received a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service during the battle. After Capt. Munch was wounded Lieut. Pfaender took command of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during the day. On the morning of April 7, Gen. Buell having arrived, the battery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle that day. The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota engaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the struggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole rebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the commanding officer. It was the first battle in which they had taken part, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks before, they had not had much opportunity for drill work. Their terrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they had met a foe worthy of their steel. Among the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained field of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in the hearts of the patriotic people of St. Paul,--a name that was as dear to the people of St. Paul as was the memory of the immortal Ellsworth to the people of Chicago. Capt. William Henry Acker, while marching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with voice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray, was pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the ill-fated field. Before going into action Capt. Acker was advised by his comrades not to wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel bullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die he would die with his harness on. Soon after forming his command into line, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out by a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the. company to receive fatal injuries. \"Loved, almost adored, by the company,\" says one of them, writing of the sad event, \"Capt. Acker's fall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command.\" It was but for a moment. With a last look at their dead commander, and with the watchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns carried death into the ranks of his murderers. From that moment but one feeling seemed to possess his still living comrades--that of revenge for the death of their captain. How terribly they carried out that purpose the number of rebel slain piled around the vicinity of his body fearfully attest. The announcement of the death of Capt. Acker was a very severe blow to his relatives and many friends in this city.

The announcement of the death of Capt. Acker was a very severe blow to his relatives and many friends in this city. No event thus far in the history of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing sense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the battlefield. A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of freedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the nation's heroes. Capt. Acker was born a soldier--brave, able, popular and courteous--and had he lived would undoubtedly been placed high in rank long before the close of the rebellion. No person ever went to the front in whom the citizens of St. Paul had more hope for a brilliant future. He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight years of age at the time of his death. He came to St. Paul in 1854 and commenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon. Edmund Rice. He did not remain long in the law business, however, but soon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just been established by ex-Gov. Marshall. For some time he was captain of the Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming, and which was the finest military organization in the West at that time. In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a marching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham Lincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that exciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that great struggle that soon followed. Little did the captain imagine at that time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so soon be the means of his untimely death. At the breaking out of the war Capt. Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he thought he would be of more use to his country in active service and resigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota regiment, of which he was made captain. At the first battle of Bull Run he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in the Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had been recently created by act of congress. The Sixteenth regiment was attached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle, and Cat. Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day, being shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded at the first battle of Bull Run. As soon as the news was received in St. Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon. Henry Acker, left for Pittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his martyred son and bring the body back to St. Paul. His body was easily found, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the Second Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after the battle. When the remains arrived in St. Paul they were met at the steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to Masonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral. The funeral obsequies were held at St. Paul's church on Sunday, May 4, 1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that had ever attended a funeral in St. Paul, many being present from Minneapolis, St. Anthony and Stillwater. The respect shown to the memory of Capt. Acker was universal, and of a character which fully demonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St. Paul. When the first Grand Army post was formed in St. Paul a name commemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the organization. Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the cause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the heroic Capt. Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first association of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as Acker post. THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN. The terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of April 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling announcement that had been made during the long crisis through which the country had just passed. Every head was bowed in grief. No tongue could find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the fiendish act. The entire country was plunged in mourning. It was not safe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred president. At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity more deeply felt than in St. Paul. All public and private buildings were draped in mourning. Every church held memorial services. The services at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long be remembered by all those who were there. The church was heavily draped in mourning. It had been suddenly transformed from a house of hope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe. The pastor of the church was the Rev. Frederick A. Noble. He was one of the most eloquent and learned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the Henry Ward Beecher of the Northwest. President Lincoln was his ideal statesman. The members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic. Many of their number were at the front defending their imperiled country. Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring a vigorous prosecution of the war. During the darkest days of the Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the Union seemed furthest off, Mr. Noble never faltered; he believed that the cause", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d9cb7dc890f79266a4c27289acbd4e0f", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "Lincoln was his ideal statesman.

Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring a vigorous prosecution of the war. During the darkest days of the Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the Union seemed furthest off, Mr. Noble never faltered; he believed that the cause was just and that right would finally triumph. When the terrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet had ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was so paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating. Every member of the congregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly taken from them. The services at the church on the Sunday morning following the assassination were most solemn and impressive. The little edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed. He was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony. With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience. Had the dead body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity of the occasion could not have been greater. In the discourse that followed, Mr. Noble briefly sketched the early history of the president, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had accomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair. For more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the progress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight, when it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender of Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war, he was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin. \"With malice towards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right, as God gives us to see the right,\" were utterances then fresh from the president's lips. To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed a crime most horrible. There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience. Men and women alike wept. It was supposed at the time that Secretary of State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger. It was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice president and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt prove fatal. Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the time. His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign entanglements during the long and bitter struggle. He, too, was eulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly mournful. Since that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by the hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was terrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal as when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of Abraham Lincoln. AN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE IN TWO CHAPTERS. CHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST. As the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful summer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have been seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the North Star State to the Gulf of Mexico. He was on a mission of peace and good will to the red men of the distant forest. On nearing the shore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed on discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years preceded him. \"What, ho!\" he muttered to himself; \"methinks I see a paleface toying with a dusky maiden. I will have speech with him.\" On approaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation the voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to the paleface by her side. \"From the stars I see in the firmament, the fixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future destiny of man. 'Tis with thee. O Robert, to live always. This elixer which I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for countless generations. The possession of it will enable thee to conquer all thine enemies. Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground upon which some day a great city will be erected. Thou art destined to become the mighty chief of this great metropolis. Thy reign will be long and uninterrupted. Thou wert born when the conjunction of the planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude. As the years roll away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity. Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will often come before thee for adjustment.

Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people. When the requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will come to thy aid. Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their displeasure will mean thy downfall. Let all the ends thou aimest at be to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the stars in their orbits.\" After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun. CHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY. After the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the frigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man. A wonderful change met the eye. A transformation as magnificent as it was bewildering had occurred. The same grand old bluffs looked proudly down upon the Father of Water. The same magnificent river pursued its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean. But all else had changed. The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side. Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded \"St. Paul's finest\" before leaving the shores of his native land. In the midst of this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the Okons, was the high and mighty ruler. The Okons and the followers of the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the paleface. Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic words: \"For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith,\" Verily the prophecy of the dusky maiden had been fulfilled. The paleface had become impregnably intrenched. The Okons could never be dislodged. With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons, the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface. SPELLING DOWN A SCHOOL. When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern part of Pennsylvania. It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that locality. The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known to-day. Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time. Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War to-day. It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under the peculiar conditions existing at that period. A school district that was able to support a school for six months in each year was indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil. Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a geography or grammar, but they were regarded as \"stuck up,\" and the other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far beyond their capacity. Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart each week for a spelling-match and recitation. We had our spelling match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest. I was considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to one of the great contests. One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to participate. As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal. While the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination. I had not considered the question of getting", "full_doc_id": "doc-0d473f2b05860b1d5792f67c74e3a178", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-df4b788ffe5def54bf8b99b261eaf932", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal. While the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination. I had not considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance. As soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them was from our school. I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line. They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers. When they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless. The school-master from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from his seat and said: \"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our school.\" My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the foot of the column. I felt very grateful towards our master for his compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct. The school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words, and I inwardly rejoiced. After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word \"phthisic.\" My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's lips. It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling book. It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to make way for the exercises to follow. As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word. \"Next!\" \"Next!\" \"Next!\" said the school-master, and my pulse beat faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to their seats. At last the crucial time had come. I was the only one left standing. As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said \"Next,\" I could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly spell the word. My countenance had betrayed me. With a clear and distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room I spelled out \"ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.\" \"Correct,\" said the school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness. I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark: \"I told you he could spell.\" I had spelled down four schools, and my reputation as a speller was established. Our school was declared to have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever after my name was not the last one to be called. On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat. HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS. Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth anniversary of his connection with the paper. A dozen of the old employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr. Moore at an informal dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event. Mr. Moore's service on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press. He has held his present position as the head of the composing room for about forty years. Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St. Paul from Tioga county, Pa., where he was born. He came with his brother, George W. Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian. His brother had been East and brought the boy West with him. Mr. Moore's first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St. Paul. There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns. Mr. Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a printer's \"devil.\" It is interesting in these days of water works and telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the office. He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now stands. Another of his jobs was to meet the boats. Whenever a steamer whistled Mr. Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office. It was from these papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world. He also was half the carrier staff of the paper. His territory covered all the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh street. There was no St. Paul worth mentioning beyond that.

Riley 1885 BOOK THE FIRST. AN EPIGRAM ON THE AMOURS. |We who of late were five books [001] of Naso, are now but three: this work our author has preferred to the former one. Though it should [002] now be no pleasure to thee to read us; still, the labour will be less, the two being removed. ELEGY I. _He says that he is compelled by Cupid to write of love instead of battles and that the Divinity insists on making each second Hexameter line into a Pentameter._ |I was preparing to write of arms and impetuous warfare in serious numbers, [003] the subject-matter being suited to the measure. [004] The second verse was of equal measure with the first; but Cupid is said to have smiled, and to have abstracted one foot. [005] \"Who, cruel boy, has given thee this right over my lines? We poets are the choir of _the Muses,_ the Pierian maids, not thine. What if Venus were to seize the arms of the yellow-haired Minerva, _and_ if the yellow-haired Minerva were to wave the lighted torches _of Love?_ Who would approve of Ceres holding her reign in the woods on the mountain ridges, _or_ of the fields being tilled under the control of the quivered Virgin? Who would arm Phoebus, graceful with his locks, with the sharp spear, while Mars is striking the Aonian lyre? Thy sway, O youth, is great, and far too potent; why, in thy ambition, dost thou attempt a new task? Is that which is everywhere, thine? Is Heliconian Tempe thine? Is even his own lyre hardly safe now for Phoebus? When the new page has made a good beginning in the first line, at that moment does he diminish my energies. [008] I have no subject fitted for _these_ lighter numbers, whether youth, or girl with her flowing locks arranged.\" _Thus_ was I complaining; when, at once, his quiver loosened, [009] he selected the arrows made for my destruction; and he stoutly bent upon his knee the curving bow, and said, \"Poet, receive a subject on which to sing.\" Ah wretched me! unerring arrows did that youth possess. I burn; and in my heart, _hitherto_ disengaged, does Love hold sway. _Henceforth_, in six feet [010] let my work commence; in five let it close. Farewell, ye ruthless wars, together with your numbers. My Muse, [011] to eleven feet destined to be attuned, bind with the myrtle of the sea shore thy temples encircled with their yellow _locks_. ELEGY II. _He says, that being taken captive by Love, he allows Cupid to lead him away in triumph._ |Why shall I say it is, that my bed appears thus hard to me, and that my clothes rest not upon the couch? The night, too, long as it is, have I passed without sleep; and why do the weary bones of my restless body ache? But were I assailed by any flame, I think I should be sensible of it. Or does _Love_ come unawares and cunningly attack in silent ambush? 'Tis so; his little arrows have pierced my heart; and cruel Love is tormenting the breast he has seized. Am I to yield? Or by struggling _against it_, am I to increase this sudden flame? I must yield; the burden becomes light which is borne contentedly. I have seen the flames increase when agitated by waving the torch; and when no one shook it, I have seen them die away. The galled bulls suffer more blows while at first they refuse the yoke, than those whom experience of the plough avails. The horse which is unbroken bruises his mouth with the hard curb; the one that is acquainted with arms is less sensible of the bit. Love goads more sharply and much more cruelly those who struggle, than those who agree to endure his servitude. Lo! I confess it; I am thy new-made prey, O Cupid; I am extending my conquered hands for thy commands. No war _between us_ is needed; I entreat for peace and for pardon; and no credit shall I be to thee, unarmed, conquered by thy arms. Bind thy locks with myrtle; yoke thy mother's doves; thy stepfather [014] himself will give a chariot which becomes thee. And in the chariot _so_ given thee, thou shalt stand, and with thy skill shalt guide the birds _so_ yoked [015], while the people shout \"_Io_ triumphe\" [016] aloud. The captured youths and the captive fair shall be led _in triumph_; this procession shall be a splendid triumph for thee. I myself, a recent capture, shall bear my wound _so_ lately made; and with the feelings of a captive shall I endure thy recent chains. Soundness of Understanding shall-be led along with hands bound behind his back, Shame as well, and whatever _beside_ is an enemy to the camp of Love. All things shall stand in awe of thee: towards thee the throng, stretching forth its hands, shall sing \"Io triumphe\" with loud voice. Caresses shall be thy attendants, Error too, and Madness, a troop that ever follows on thy side. With these for thy soldiers, thou dost overcome", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e937ae9f431c4368aa293a51bc61c19e", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "recent chains.

Caresses shall be thy attendants, Error too, and Madness, a troop that ever follows on thy side. With these for thy soldiers, thou dost overcome both men and Gods; take away from thee these advantages, _and_ thou wilt be helpless. From highest Olympus thy joyous mother will applaud thee in thy triumph, and will sprinkle her roses falling on thy face. While gems bedeck thy wings, _and_ gems thy hair; in thy golden chariot shalt thou go, resplendent thyself with gold. [017] Then too, (if well I know thee) wilt thou influence not a few; then too, as thou passest by, wilt thou inflict many a wound. Thy arrows (even shouldst thou thyself desire it) cannot be at rest. A glowing flame _ever_ injures by the propinquity of its heat. Just such was Bacchus when the Gangetic land [018] was subdued; thou art the burden of the birds; he was _that_ of the tigers. Therefore, since I may be some portion of thy hallowed triumph, forbear, Conqueror, to expend thy strength on me. Look at the prospering arms of thy kinsman Cæsar; [019] with the same hand with which he conquers does he shield the conquered. [020] ELEGY III. _He entreats his mistress to return his affection, and shows that he is deserving of her favour._ |I ask for what is just; let the fair who has so lately captivated me, either love me, or let her give me a cause why I should always love her. Alas! too much have I desired; only let her allow herself to be loved; _and then_ Cytherea will have listened to my prayers so numerous. Accept one who will be your servant through lengthened years; accept one who knows how to love with constant attachment. If the great names of ancient ancestors do not recommend me, or if the Equestrian founder of my family [021] _fails to do so_; and _if_ no field of mine is renewed by ploughs innumerable, and each of my parents [022] with frugal spirit limits my expenditure; still Phoebus and his nine companions and the discoverer of the vine may do so; and Love _besides_, who presents me as a gift to you; a fidelity, too that will yield to none, manners above reproach, ingenuousness without guile, and modesty _ever_ able to blush. A thousand damsels have no charms for me; I am no rover in affection; [023] you will for ever be my choice, if you do but believe me. May it prove my lot to live with you for years as many as the threads of the Sister _Destinies_ shall grant me, and to die with you sorrowing _for me_. Grant me yourself as a delightful theme for my verse; worthy of their matter my lines will flow. Io, frightened by her horns, and she whom the adulterer deceived in _the shape of_ the bird [024] of the stream have a name in song; she, too, who, borne over the seas upon the fictitious bull, held fast the bending horns with her virgin hand. We, too, together shall be celebrated throughout all the world; and my name shall ever be united with thy own. ELEGY IV. _He instructs his mistress what conduct to-observe in the presence of her husband at a feast to which he has been invited._ _Your_ husband is about to come to the same banquet [026] as ourselves: I pray that it may be the last meal [027] for this husband of yours. And am I then only as a guest to look upon the fair so much beloved? And shall there be another, to take pleasure in being touched _by you?_ And will you, conveniently placed below, be keeping warm the bosom of another? [028] _And_ shall he, when he pleases, be placing his hand upon your neck? Cease to be surprised that the beauteous damsel of Atrax [029] excited the two-formed men to combat when the wine was placed _on table_. No wood is my home, and my limbs adhere not to _those of_ a horse; _yet_ I seem to be hardly able to withhold my hands from you. Learn, however, what must be done by you; and do not give my injunctions to be borne away by the Eastern gales, nor on the warm winds of the South. Come before your husband; and yet, I do not see what can be done, if you do come first; but still, do come first. [031] When he presses the couch, with modest air you will be going as his companion, to recline by him; _then_ secretly touch my foot. [032] Keep your eye on me, and my nods and the expression of my features; apprehend my secret signs, [033] and yourself return them. Without utterance will I give expression to words by my eyebrows; [034] you shall read words traced by my fingers, words _traced_ in the wine. [035] When the delights of our dalliance recur to your thoughts, press your blooming cheeks [036] with your beauteous finger.

[035] When the delights of our dalliance recur to your thoughts, press your blooming cheeks [036] with your beauteous finger. If there shall be anything, of which you may be making complaint about me silently in your mind, let your delicate hand reach from the extremity of your ear. When, my life, I shall either do or say aught which shall give you delight, let your ring be continually twisted on your fingers. [037] Take hold of the table with your hand, in the way in which those who are in prayer [038] take hold _of the altar_, when you shall be wishing many an evil for your husband, who so well deserves it. _The cup_ which he has mixed for you, if you are discreet, [039] bid him drink himself; _then_, in a low voice, do you ask the servant [041] for what _wine_ you wish. I will at once take the cup which you have put down; [042] and where you have sipped, on that side will I drink. If, perchance, he shall give you any morsels, of which he has tasted beforehand, reject them _thus_ touched by his mouth. [043] And do not allow him to press your neck, by putting his arms around it; nor recline your gentle head on his unsightly breast. [044] Let not your bosom, or your breasts so close at hand, [045] admit his fingers; _and_ especially allow him to give you no kisses. If you do give him _any_ kisses, I shall be discovered to be your lover, and I shall say, \"Those are my own,\" and shall be laying hands upon him. Still, this I shall _be able to_ see; but what the clothing carefully conceals, the same will be a cause for me of apprehension full of doubts. Touch not his thigh with yours, and cross not legs with him, and do not unite your delicate foot with his uncouth leg. To my misery, I am apprehensive of many a thing, because many a thing have I done in my wantonness; and I myself am tormented, through fear of my own precedent. Oft _by joining hands_ beneath the cloth, [048] have my mistress and I forestalled our hurried delights. This, I _am sure_, you will not do _for him_; but that you may not _even_ be supposed to do so, take away the conscious covering [049] from your bosom. Bid your husband drink incessantly, but let there be no kisses with your entreaties; and while he is drinking, if you can, add wine by stealth. [050] If he shall be soundly laid asleep with dozing and wine, circumstances and opportunity will give us _fitting_ counsel. When you shall rise to go home, we all will rise as well; _and_ remember that you walk in the middle rank of the throng. In that rank you will either find me, or be found _by me_; _and_ whatever part of me you can there touch, _mind and_ touch. Ah wretched me! I have given advice to be good for _but_ a few hours; _then_, at the bidding of night, I am separated from my mistress. At night her husband will lock her in; I, sad with my gushing tears, will follow her as far as I may, even to her obdurate door. _And_ now will he be snatching a kiss; _and_ now not kisses only will he snatch; you will be compelled to grant him that, which by stealth you grant to me. But grant him this (you can do so) with a bad grace, and like one acting by compulsion; let no caresses be heard; and let Venus prove inauspicious. If my wishes avail, I trust, too, that he will find no satisfaction therein; but if otherwise, still at least let it have no delights for you. But, however, whatever luck may attend upon the night, assure me in positive language to-morrow, that you did not dally with him. ELEGY V. _The beauties of Corinna._ |Twas summer time, [051] and the day had passed the hour of noon; _when_ I threw my limbs to be refreshed on the middle of the couch. A part of the window [053] was thrown open, the other part shut; the light was such as the woods are wont to have; just as the twilight glimmers, when Phoebus is retreating; or _as_ when the night has gone, and still the day is not risen. Such light should be given to the bashful fair, in which coy modesty may hope to have concealment. Behold! Corinna [054] came, clothed in a tunic [055] hanging loose, her flowing hair [056] covering her white neck. Beauteous Semiramis [057] is said to have entered her chamber, and Lais, [058] beloved by many a hero. I drew aside the tunic; in its thinness [059] it was but a small impediment; still, to be covered with the tunic did she strive; and, as she struggled as though she was not desirous to conquer, without difficulty was she overcome, through betrayal of herself. When, her clothing laid aside, she stood before my eyes, throughout her whole body nowhere was there a blemish.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-6bd2afa94631d5184fe4ed1acaebe619", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "chamber, and Lais, [058] beloved by many a hero.

When, her clothing laid aside, she stood before my eyes, throughout her whole body nowhere was there a blemish. What shoulders, what arms I _both_ saw and touched! The contour of her breast, how formed was it to be pressed! How smooth her stomach beneath her faultless bosom! How full and how beauteous her sides! How plump with youthfulness the thigh! _But_ why enlarge on every point? Nothing did I behold not worthy of praise; and I pressed her person even to my own. The rest, who knows not? Wearied, we both reclined. May such a midday often prove my lot. ELEGY VI. _He entreats the porter to open to him the door of his mistress's house._ Porter, fastened (_and_ how unworthily!) with the cruel fetter, [060] throw open the stubborn door with its turning hinge. What I ask, is but a trifle; let the door, half-opened, admit me sideways with its narrow passage. Protracted Love has made my body thin for such an emergency, and by diminishing my bulk, has rendered my limbs _quite_ supple.'Tis he who shows me how to go softly amid the watches of the keepers; [062] 'tis he directs my feet that meet no harm. But, at one time, I used to be afraid of the night and imaginary ghosts; _and_ I used to be surprised if any one was about to go in the dark: Cupid, with his graceful mother, laughed, so that I could hear him, and he softly said, \"Thou too wilt become bold.\" Without delay, love came _upon me_; then, I feared not spectres that flit by night, [063] or hands uplifted for my destruction. I only fear you, _thus_ too tardy; you alone do I court; you hold the lightning by which you can effect my destruction. Look (and that you may see, loosen the obdurate bars) how the door has been made wet with my tears. At all events, 'twas I, who, when, your garment laid aside, you stood ready for the whip, [064] spoke in your behalf to your mistress as you were trembling. Does then, (O shocking thought!) the credit which once prevailed in your behalf, now fail to prevail in my own favour? Give a return for my kindness; you may _now_ be grateful. As you wish, [065] the hours of the night pass on; [066] from the door-post [067] strike away the bar. Strike it away then may you one day be liberated from your long fetters and may the water of the slave [068] be not for ever drunk of by you. Hard-hearted porter! you hear me, as I implore in vain; the door, supported by its hard oaken _posts_, is still unmoved. Let the protection of a closed gate be of value to cities when besieged; _but_ why, in the midst of peace are you dreading warfare? What would you do to an enemy, who thus shut out the lover? The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. I am not come attended with soldiers and with arms; I should be alone, if ruthless Love were not here. Him, even if I should desire it, I can never send away; first should I be even severed from my limbs. Love then, and a little wine about my temples, [069] are with me, and the chaplet falling from off my anointed hair. Who is to dread arms _such_ as these? Who may not go out to face them? The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. Are you delaying? or does sleep (who but ill befriends the lover) give to the winds my words, as they are repelled from your ear? But, I remember, when formerly I used to avoid you, you were awake, with the stars of the midnight. Perhaps, too, your own mistress is now asleep with you; alas! how much superior _then_ is your fate to my own! And since 'tis so, pass on to me, ye cruel chains. The hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar. Am I mistaken? Or did the door-posts creak with the turning hinge, and did the shaken door give the jarring signal? Yes, I am mistaken; the door was shaken by the boisterous wind. Ah me! how far away has that gust borne my hopes! Boreas, if well thou dost keep in mind the ravished Orithyia, come hither, and with thy blast beat open this relentless door. 'Tis silence throughout all the City; damp with the glassy dew, the hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar.

Night, and lore, and wine, [075] are persuasive of no moderation; the first is without shame, Bacchus and Love _are without fear_. I have expended every method; neither by entreaties nor by threats have I moved you, O _man, even_ more deaf yourself than your door. It becomes you not to watch the threshold of the beauteous fair; of the anxieties of the prison, [076] are you more deserving. And now Lucifer is moving his wheels beset with rime; and the bird is arousing [077] wretched _mortals_ to their work. But, chaplet taken from my locks joyous no longer, be you the livelong night upon this obdurate threshold. You, when in the morning she shall see you _thus_ exposed, will be a witness of my time thus thrown away. _Porter_, whatever your disposition, good bye, and _one day_ experience the pangs of him who is now departing; sluggish one, and worthless in not admitting the lover, fare you well. And you, ye cruel door-posts, with your stubborn threshold; and _you, ye_ doors, equally slaves, [078] hard-hearted blocks of wood, farewell. ELEGY VII. _He has beaten his mistress, and endeavours to regain her favour._ |Put my hands in manacles (they are deserving of chains), if any friend of mine is present, until all my frenzy has departed. For frenzy has raised my rash arms against my mistress; hurt by my frantic hand, the fair is weeping. In such case could I have done an injury even to my dear parents, or have given unmerciful blows to even the hallowed Gods. Why; did not Ajax, too, [080] the owner of the sevenfold shield, slaughter the flocks that he had caught along the extended plains? And did Orestes, the guilty avenger of his father, the punisher of his mother, dare to ask for weapons against the mystic Goddesses? [081] And could I then tear her tresses so well arranged; and were not her displaced locks unbecoming to my mistress? Even thus was she beauteous; in such guise they say that the daughter of Schoeneus [082] pursued the wild beasts of Mænalus with her bow. 'Twere more fitting for her face to be pale from the impress of kisses, and for her neck to bear the marks of the toying teeth. In such guise did the Cretan damsel [083] weep, that the South winds, in their headlong flight, had borne away both the promises and the sails of the forsworn Theseus. Thus, _too_, chaste Minerva, did Cassandra [084] fall in thy temple, except that her locks were bound with the fillet. Who did not say to me, \"You madman!\" who did not say _to me_, \"You barbarian!\" She herself _said_ not a word; her tongue was restrained by timid apprehensions. But still her silent features pronounced my censure; by her tears _and_ by her silent lips did she convict me. First could I wish that my arms had fallen from off my shoulders; to better purpose could I have parted with a portion of myself. To my own disadvantage had I the strength of a madman; and for my own punishment did I stoutly exert my strength. What do I want with you, ye ministers of death and criminality? Impious hands, submit to the chains, your due. Should I not have been punished had I struck the humblest Roman [085] of the multitude? _And_ shall I have a greater privilege against my mistress? The son of Tydeus has left the worst instance of crime: he was the first to strike a Goddess, [086] I, the second. But less guilty was he; by me, she, whom I asserted to be loved _by me_, was injured; against an enemy the son of Tydeus was infuriate. Come now, conqueror, prepare your boastful triumphs; bind your locks with laurel, and pay your vows to Jove, and let the multitude, the train, that escorts your chariot, shout aloud, \"Io _triumphe!_ by _this_ valiant man has the fair been conquered!\" Let the captive, in her sadness, go before with dishevelled locks, pale all over, if her hurt cheeks [087] may allow. In short, if, after the manner of a swelling torrent, I was impelled, and if impetuous anger did make me its prey; would it not have been enough to have shouted aloud at the trembling girl, and not to have thundered out my threats far too severe? Or else, to my own disgrace, to have torn her tunic from its upper edge down to the middle? Her girdle should, at the middle [089] have come to its aid. But now, in the hardness of my heart, I could dare, seizing her hair on her forehead, to mark her free-born cheeks [090] with my nails. _There_ she stood, amazed, with her features pale and bloodless, just as the marble is cut in the Parian mountains. [091] I saw her fainting limbs, and her palpitating members; just as when the breeze waves the foliage of the poplars; just as the slender reed quivers with the gentle Zephyr; or, as when the surface of the waves", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-ba43616fff0b8112616e172e23cfa8d7", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "her hair on her forehead, to mark her free-born cheeks [090] with my nails. _There_ she stood, amazed, with her features pale and bloodless, just as the marble is cut in the Parian mountains.

Her tears, too, so long repressed, flowed down her face, just as the water flows from the snow when heaped up. Then, for the first time, did I begin to be sensible that I was guilty; the tears which she was shedding were _as_ my own blood. Yet, thrice was I ready, suppliantly to throw myself before her feet; thrice did she repel my dreaded hands. But, _dearest,_ do not you hesitate, (_for_ revenge will lessen your grief) at once to attack my face with your nails. Spare not my eyes, nor _yet_ my hair; let anger nerve your hands, weak though they may be. And that tokens so shocking of my criminality may no longer exist, put your locks, arranged anew, in their proper order. [092] ELEGY VIII. _He curses a certain procuress, whom he overhears instructing his mistress in the arts of a courtesan._ |There is a certain--(whoever wishes to make acquaintance with a procuress, let him listen.)--There is a certain old hag, Dipsas by name. From fact does she derive [094] her name; never in a sober state does she behold the mother of the swarthy Memnon with her horses of roseate hue. She knows well the magic arts, and the charms of Ææa, [095] and by her skill she turns back to its source [096] the flowing stream. She knows right well what the herbs, what the thrums impelled around the whirling spinning-wheel, [097] _and_ what the venomous exudation [098] from the prurient mare can effect. When she wills it, the clouds are overspread throughout all the sky; when she wills it, the day is bright with a clear atmosphere. I have beheld (if I may be believed) the stars dripping with blood: the face of the moon was empurpled [099] with gore. I believe that she, transformed, [101] was flying amid the shades of night, and that her hag's carcase was covered with feathers. _This_ I believe, and such is the report. A double pupil, too, [102] sparkles in her eyes, and light proceeds from a twofold eyeball. Forth from the ancient sepulchres she calls our great grandsires, and their grandsires [103] as well; and with her long incantations she cleaves the solid ground. She has made it her occupation to violate the chaste bed; and besides, her tongue is not \"wanting in guilty advocacy. Chance made me the witness of her language; in such words was she giving her advice; the twofold doors [105] concealed me. \"You understand, my life, how greatly you yesterday pleased a wealthy young man; _for_ he stopped short, and stood gazing for some time on your face. And whom do you not please? Your beauty is inferior to no one's. _But_ woe is me! your person has not a fitting dress. I _only_ wish you were as well off, as you are distinguished for beauty; if you became rich, I should not be poor. The adverse star of Mars in opposition [106] was unfortunate for you; Mars has gone; now Venus is befriending you with her planet. See now how favourable she is on her approach; a rich lover is sighing for you, and he makes it his care [107] what are your requirements. He has good looks, too, that may compare with your own; if he did not wish to have you at a price, he were worthy himself to be purchased.\" _On this the damsel_ blushed: [108] \"Blushing,\" _said the hag_, \"suits a faircomplexion indeed; but if you _only_ pretend it, 'tis an advantage; _if_ real, it is wont to be injurious. When, your eyes cast down, [109] you are looking full upon your bosom, each man must _only_ be looked at in the proportion in which he offers. Possibly the sluttish Sabine females, [111] when Tati us was king, were unwilling to be accommodating to more men _than one_. Now-a-days, Mars employs the bravery _of our men_ in foreign warfare; [112] but Venus holds sway in the City of her own Æneas. Enjoy yourselves, my pretty ones; she is chaste, whom nobody has courted; or else, if coyness does not prevent her, she herself is the wooer. Dispel these frowns [113] as well, which you are carrying upon your lofty brow; with those frowns will numerous failings be removed. Penelope used to try [114] the strength of the young men upon the bow; the bow that tested _the strength_ of their sides, was made of horn.

Penelope used to try [114] the strength of the young men upon the bow; the bow that tested _the strength_ of their sides, was made of horn. Age glides stealthily on, and beguiles us as it flies; just as the swift river glides onward with its flowing waters. Brass grows bright by use; good clothes require to be worn; uninhabited buildings grow white with nasty mould. Unless you entertain _lovers_, beauty _soon_ waxes old, with no one to enjoy it; and _even_ one or two _lovers_ are not sufficiently profitable. From many _of them_, gain is more sure, and not so difficult to be got. An abundant prey falls to the hoary wolves out of a _whole_ flock. \"See now! what does this poet of yours make you a present of besides his last verses? You will read many thousands of them by _this_ new lover. The God himself of poets, graceful in his mantle [116] adorned with gold, strikes the harmonious strings of the gilded lyre. He that shall make you presents, let him be to you greater than great Homer; believe me, it is a noble thing to give. And, if there shall be any one redeemed at a price for his person [117], do not you despise him; the fault of having the foot rubbed with chalk [118] is a mere trifle. Neither let the old-fashioned wax busts about the halls [119] take you in; pack off with your forefathers, you needy lover. Nay more, should [120] one, because he is good-looking, ask for a night without a present; _why_, let him first solicit his own admirer for something to present to you. \"Be less exacting of presents, while you are laying your nets, _for fear_ lest they should escape you: _once_ caught, tease them at your own pleasure. Pretended affection, too, is not a bad thing; let him fancy he is loved; but have you a care that this affection is not all for nothing. Often refuse your favours; sometimes pretend a head-ache; and sometimes there will be Isis [121] to afford a pretext. _But_ soon admit him again; that he may acquire no habits of endurance, and that his love, so often repulsed, may not begin to flag. Let your door be deaf to him who entreats, open to him who brings. Let the lover that is admitted, hear the remarks of him who is excluded. And, as though you were the first injured, sometimes get in a passion with him when injured _by you_. His censure, when counterbalanced by your censure, [127] may wear away. But do you never afford a long duration for anger; prolonged anger frequently produces hatred. Moreover, let your eyes learn, at discretion, to shed tears; and let this cause or that cause your cheeks to be wet. And do not, if you deceive any one, hesitate to be guilty of perjury; Venus lends _but_ a deaf hearing [128] to deceived _lovers_. \"Let a male servant and a crafty handmaid [129] be trained up to their parts; who may instruct him what may be conveniently purchased for you. And let them ask but little for themselves; if they ask a little of many, [130] very soon, great will be the heap from the gleanings. [131] Let your sister, and your mother, and your nurse as well, fleece your admirer. A booty is soon made, that is sought by many hands. When occasions for asking for presents shall fail you, call attention with a cake [132] to your birthday Take care that no one loves you in security, without a rival; love is not very lasting if you remove _all_ rivalry. Let him perceive the traces of _another_ person on the couch; all your neck, too, discoloured by the marks of toying. Especially let him see the presents, which another has sent. If he gives you nothing, the Sacred Street [133] must be talked about. When you have received many things, but yet he has not given you every thing, be continually asking him to lend you something, for you never to return. Let your tongue aid you, and let it conceal your thoughts; [134] caress him, and prove his ruin. [135] Beneath the luscious honey cursed poisons lie concealed. If you observe these precepts, tried by me throughout a long experience; and if the winds and the breezes do not bear away my words; often will you bless me while I live; often will you pray, when I am dead, that in quietude my bones may repose.\". She was in the middle of her speech, when my shadow betrayed me; but my hands with difficulty refrained from tearing her grey scanty locks, and her eyes bleared with wine, and her wrinkled cheeks. May the Gods grant you both no home, [136] and a needy old age; prolonged winters as well, and everlasting thirst. ELEGY IX. _He tells Atticus that like the soldier, the lover ought to be on his guard and that Love is a species of warfare._ |Every lover is a soldier, and Cupid has a camp of his own; believe me, Atticus, [138] every lover is a soldier. The age which is fitted for war, is suited to love as well. For an old man to be a soldier, is shocking; amorousness in an old man is shocking.

The age which is fitted for war, is suited to love as well. For an old man to be a soldier, is shocking; amorousness in an old man is shocking. The years which [139] generals require in the valiant soldier, the same does the charming fair require in her husband. Both _soldier and lover_ pass sleepless nights; both rest upon the ground. The one watches at the door of his mistress; but the other _at that_ of his general. [140] Long marches are the duty of the soldier; send the fair _far_ away, _and_ the lover will boldly follow her, without a limit _to his endurance_. Over opposing mountains will he go, and rivers swollen with rains; the accumulating snows will he pace. About to plough the waves, he will not reproach the stormy East winds; nor will he watch for Constellations favourable for scudding over the waves. Who, except either the soldier or the lover, will submit to both the chill of the night, and the snows mingled with the heavy showers? The one is sent as a spy against the hostile foe; the other keeps his eye on his rival, as though upon an enemy. The one lays siege to stubborn cities, the other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress: the one bursts open gates, and the other, doors. [142] Full oft has it answered to attack the enemy when buried in sleep; and to slaughter an unarmed multitude with armed hand. Thus did the fierce troops of the Thracian Rhesus [143] fall; and you, captured steeds, forsook your lord. Full oft do lovers take advantage of the sleep of husbands, and brandish their arms against the slumbering foe. To escape the troops of the sentinels, and the bands of the patrol, is the part _both_ of the soldier, and of the lover always in misery. Mars is wayward, and Venus is uncertain; both the conquered rise again, and those fall whom you would say could never possibly be prostrate. Whoever, then, has pronounced Love _mere_ slothfulness, let him cease _to love_: [144] to the discerning mind does Love belong. The mighty Achilles is inflamed by the captive Briseis. Trojans, while you may, destroy the Argive resources. Hector used to go to battle _fresh_ from the embraces of Andromache; and it was his wife who placed his helmet on his head. The son of Atreus, the first of _all_ the chiefs, on beholding the daughter of Priam, is said to have been smitten with the dishevelled locks of the raving _prophetess_. [146] Mars, too, when caught, was sensible of the chains wrought at the forge; [147] there was no story better known than his, in all the heavens. I myself was of slothful habit, and born for a lazy inactivity; [148] the couch and the shade [149] had enervated my mind. Attentions to the charming fair gave a fillip to me, in my indolence; and _Love_ commanded me to serve [150] in his camp. Hence it is that thou seest me active, and waging the warfare by night. Let him who wishes not to become slothful, fall in love. ELEGY X. _He tells his mistress that she ought not to require presents as a return for her love._ |Such as she, who, borne away from the Eurotas, [151] in the Phrygian ships, was the cause of warfare to her two husbands; such as Leda was, whom her crafty paramour, concealed in his white feathers, deceived under _the form of_ a fictitious bird; such as Amymone [152] used to wander in the parched _fields of_ Argos, when the urn was pressing the locks on the top of her head; such were you; and I was in dread of both the eagle and the bull with respect to you, and whatever _form besides_ Love has created of the mighty Jove. Now, all fears are gone, and the disease of my mind is cured; and now no longer does that form _of yours_ rivet my eyes. Do you inquire why I am changed? _It is_, because you require presents. This reason does not allow of your pleasing me. So long as you were disinterested, I was in love with your mind together with your person; now, _in my estimation_ your appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition. Love is both a child and naked; he has years without sordidness, and _he wears_ no clothes, that he may be without concealment. Why do you require the son of Venus to be prostituted at a price? He has no fold in his dress, [153] in which to conceal that price. Neither Venus is suited for cruel arms, nor yet the son of Venus; it befits not such unwarlike Divinities to serve for pay. The courtesan stands for hire to any one at a certain price; and with her submissive body, she seeks for wretched pelf.

Still, she curses the tyranny of the avaricious procurer; [154] and she does by compulsion [155] what you are doing of your own free will. Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking thing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes. The mare asks no gift of the horse, nor the cow of the bull; the ram does not woo the ewe, induced by presents. Woman alone takes pleasure in spoils torn from the man; she alone lets out her nights; alone is she on sale, to be hired at a price. She sells, too, _joys_ that delight them both, _and_ which both covet; and she makes it a _matter_ of pay, at what price she herself is to be gratified. Those joys, which are so equally sweet to both, why does the one sell, and _why_ the other buy them? Why must that delight prove a loss to me, to you a gain, for which the female and the male combine with kindred impulse? Witnesses hired dishonestly, [156] sell their perjuries; the chest [157] of the commissioned judge [158] is disgracefully open _for the bribe_. 'Tis a dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with a tongue that is purchased; [159] 'tis a disgrace for a tribunal to make great acquisitions. 'Tis a disgrace for a woman to increase her patrimonial possessions by the profits of her embraces, and to prostitute her beauty for lucre. Thanks are _justly_ due for things obtained without purchase; there are no thanks for an intercourse disgracefully bartered. He who hires, [160] pays all _his due_; the price _once_ paid, he no longer remains a debtor for your acquiescence. Cease, ye beauties, to bargain for pay for your favours. Sordid gains bring no good results. It was not worth her while to bargain for the Sabine bracelets, [161] in order that the arms should crush the head of the sacred maiden. The son pierced [163] with the sword those entrails from which he had sprung, and a simple necklace [164] was the cause of the punishment. But yet it is not unbecoming for a present to be asked of the wealthy man; he has something to give to her who does ask for a present. Pluck the grapes that hang from the loaded vines; let the fruitful soil of Alcinous [165] afford the apples. Let the needy man proffer duty, zeal, and fidelity; what each one possesses, let him bestow it all upon his mistress. My endowments, too, are in my lines to shig the praises of those fair who deserve them; she, whom I choose, becomes celebrated through my skill. Vestments will rend, gems and gold will spoil; the fame which poesy confers is everlasting. _Still_ I do not detest giving and revolt at it, but at being asked for a price. Cease to demand it, _and_ I will give you that which I refuse you while you ask. ELEGY XI. _He begs Nape to deliver his letter to her mistress, and commences by praising her neatness and dexterity, and the interest she has hitherto manifested in his behalf._ |Nape, skilled at binding the straggling locks [166] and arranging them in order, and not deserving to be reckoned [167] among the female slaves; _known_, too, _by experience_ to be successful in the contrivances of the stealthy night, and clever in giving the signals; [168] you who have so oft entreated Corinna, when hesitating, to come to me; who have been found so often faithful by me in my difficulties; take and carry these tablets, [169] so well-filled, [170] this morning to your mistress; and by your diligence dispel _all_ impeding delay. Neither veins of flint, nor hard iron is in your breast, nor have you a simplicity greater than that of your _clever_ class. There is no doubt that you, too, have experienced the bow of Cupid; in my behalf defend the banner of your service. If _Corinna_ asks what I am doing, you will say that I am living in expectation of the night. The wax inscribed with my persuasive hand is carrying the rest. While I am speaking, time is flying; opportunely give her my tablets, when she is at leisure; but still, make her read them at once. I bid you watch her eyes and her forehead as she reads; from the silent features we may know the future. And _be there_ no delay; when she has read them through, request her to write a long answer; [172] I hate it, when the bleached wax is empty, with a margin on every side. Let her write the lines close as they run, and let the letters traced in the extreme margin long detain my eyes. _But_ what need is there for wearying her fingers with holding the pen? [175] Let the whole of her letter contain this one word, \"Come.\" Then, I should not delay to crown my victorious tablets with laurel, nor to place them in the midst of the temple of Venus. Beneath them I would inscribe \"Naso consecrates these faithful servants of his to Venus; but lately, you were pieces of worthless maple.\" [176] ELEGY XII. _He curses the tablets which he has sent, because his mistress has written an answer on them, in which she refuses to grant", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9ff2030ce7e35257099d54aca8256ea4", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "this one word, \"Come.\" Then, I should not delay to crown my victorious tablets with laurel, nor to place them in the midst of the temple of Venus.

Her unlucky letter announces that she cannot _be seen_ to-day. There is something in omens; just now, when she was preparing to go, Napè stopped short, having struck her foot [178] against the threshold. When sent out of doors another time, remember to pass the threshold more carefully, and _like_ a sober woman lift your foot high _enough._ Away with you; obdurate tablets, fatal bits of board; and you wax, as well, crammed with the lines of denial. I doubt the Corsican bee [180] has sent you collected from the blossom of the tall hemlock, beneath its abominable honey. Besides, you were red, as though you had been thoroughly dyed in vermilion; [181] such a colour is exactly that of blood. Useless bits of board, thrown out in the street, _there_ may you lie; and may the weight of the wheel crush you, as it passes along. I could even prove that he who formed you to shape from the tree, had not the hands of innocence. That tree surely has afforded a gibbet for some wretched neck, _and_ has supplied the dreadful crosses [182] for the executioner. It has given a disgusting shelter to the screeching owls; in its branches it has borne the eggs of the vulture and of the screech-owl. [183] In my madness, have I entrusted my courtship to these, and have I given soft words to be _thus_ carried to my mistress? These tablets would more becomingly hold the prosy summons, [184] which some judge [185] pronounces, with his sour face. ELEGY XIII. _He entreats the morning not to hasten on with its usual speed._ |Now over the Ocean does she come from her aged husband _Tithonus_, who, with her yellow locks, brings on the day with her frosty chariot. Whither, Aurora, art thou hastening? Stay; _and_ then may the yearly bird, with its wonted death, honour the shades [189] of thy Memnon, its parent. Now do I delight to recline in the soft arms of my mistress; now, if ever, is she deliciously united to my side. Now, too, slumbers are sound, and now the moisture is cooling the birds, too, are sweetly waronng with their little throats. Whither art thou hastening, hated by the men, detested by the fair? Check thy dewy reins with thy rosy hand. [190] Before thy rising, the sailor better observes his Constellations; and he wanders not in ignorance, in the midst of the waves. On thy approach, the wayfarer arises, weary though he be; the soldier lays upon his arms the hands used to bear them. Thou art the first to look upon the tillers of the fields laden with the two-pronged fork; thou art the first to summon the lagging oxen to the crooked yoke. 'Tis thou who dost deprive boys of their sleep, and dost hand them over to their masters; [192], that their tender hands may suffer the cruel stripes. [193] 'Tis thou, too, who dost send the man before the vestibule of the attorney, [194] when about to become bail; [195] that he may submit to the great risks of a single word. Thou art no source of pleasure to the pleader, [198] nor yet to the counsel; for fresh combats each is forced to rise. Thou, when the labours of the females might have had a pause, dost recal the hand of the worker in wool to its task. All _this_ I could endure; but who could allow the fair to arise _thus_ early, except _the man_ who has no mistress of his own? How often have I wished that night would not make way for thee; and that the stars when put to flight would not fly from thy countenance. Many a time have I wished that either the wind would break thy chariot to pieces, or that thy steed would fall, overtaken by _some_ dense cloud. Remorseless one, whither dost thou hasten? Inasmuch as thy son was black, such was the colour of his mother's heart. What if [199] she had not once burned with passion for Cephalus? Or does she fancy that her escapade was not known? I _only_ wish it was allowed Tithonus to tell of thee; there would not be a more coarse tale in _all_ the heavens. While thou art avoiding him, because he is chilled by length of years, thou dost rise early in the morning from _the bed of_ the old man to thy odious chariot.

But if thou wast _only_ holding some Cephalus embraced in thy arms; _then_ wouldst thou be crying out, \"Run slowly on, ye horses of the night.\" Why should I be punished in my affections, if thy husband does decay through _length of_ years? Wast thou married to the old fellow by my contrivance? See how many hours of sleep the Moon gave [201] to the youth beloved by _her_; and yet her beauty is not inferior to thine. The parent of the Gods himself, that he might not see thee so often, joined two nights together [202] for _the attainment of_ his desires. I had finished my reproaches; you might be sure she heard them; _for_ she blushed'. However, no later than usual did the day arise. ELEGY XIV. _His mistress having been in the habit of dyeing her hair with noxious compositions, she has nearly lost it, becoming almost bald. He reminds her of his former advice, and entreats her to abstain from the practice, on which there may be a chance of her recovering it._ |I always used to say; \"Do leave off doctoring your hair.\" [203] _And_ now you have no hair _left_, that you can be dyeing. But, if you had let it alone, what was more plenteous than it? It used to reach down your sides, so far as ever [204] they extend. And besides: Was it not so fine, that you were afraid to dress [205] it; just like the veils [206] which the swarthy Seres use? Or _like_ the thread which the spider draws out with her slender legs, when she fastens her light work beneath the neglected beam? And yet its colour was not black, nor yet was it golden, but though it was neither, it was a mixture of them both. A _colour_, such as the tall cedar has in the moist vallies of craggy Ida, when its bark is stript off. Besides, it was _quite_ tractable, and falling into a thousand ringlets; and it was the cause of no trouble to you. Neither the bodkin, [208] nor the tooth of the comb _ever_ tore it; your tire woman always had a whole skin. Many a time was it dressed before my eyes; and _yet_, never did the bodkin [210] seized make wounds in her arms. Many a time too, in the morning, her locks not yet arranged, was she lying on the purple couch, with her face half upturned. Then even, unadorned, was she beauteous; as when the Thracian Bacchanal, in her weariness, throws herself carelessly upon the green grass. Still, fine as it was, and just like down, what evils, alas! did her tortured hair endure! How patiently did it submit itself to the iron and the fire; [211] that the curls might become crisp with their twisting circlets. \"'Tis a shame,\" I used to cry, \"'tis a shame, to be burning that hair; naturally it is becoming; do, cruel one, be merciful to your own head. Away with all violence from it; it is not _hair_ that deserves to be scorched; the very locks instruct [212] the bodkins when applied.\" Those beauteous locks are gone; which Apollo might have longed for, _and_ which Bacchus might have wished to be on his own head. With them I might compare those, which naked Dione is painted [213] as once having held up with her dripping hand. Why are you complaining that hair so badly treated is gone? Why, silly girl, do you lay down the mirror [214] with disconsolate hand? You are not seen to advantage by yourself with eyes accustomed _to your former self._ For you to please, you ought to be forgetful of your _former_ self. No enchanted herbs of a rival [215] have done you this injury; no treacherous hag has been washing you with Itæmonian water. The effects, too, of no disease have injured you; (far away be all _bad_ omens; [216]) nor has an envious tongue thinned your abundant locks;'twas your own self who gave the prepared poison to your head. Now Germany will be sending [217] for you her captured locks; by the favour of a conquered race you will be adorned. Ah! how many a time will you have to blush, as any one admires your hair; and _then_ you will say, \"Now I am receiving praise for a bought commodity! In place of myself, he is now bepraising some Sygambrian girl [218] unknown to me; still, I remember _the time_ when that glory was my own.\" Wretch that I am! with difficulty does she restrain her tears; and she covers her face with her hand, having her delicate cheeks suffused with blushes. She is venturing to look at her former locks, _placed_ in her bosom; a treasure, alas! not fitted for that spot. [219] Calm your feelings with your features; the loss may still be repaired. Before long, you will become beauteous with your natural hair.

ELEGY XV. _He tells the envious that the fame of Poets is immortal, and that theirs is not a life devoted to idleness._ |Why, gnawing Envy, dost thou blame me for years of slothfulness; and _why_ dost thou call poesy the employment of an idle mind? _Thou sayest_ that I do not, after the manner of my ancestors, while vigorous years allow me, seek the prizes of warfare covered with dust; that I do not make myself acquainted with the prosy law, and that I have not let my tongue for hire [221] in the disagreeable courts of justice. The pursuits of which thou art speaking, are perishable; by me, everlasting fame is sought; that to all time I may be celebrated throughout the whole world. The Mæonian bard [222] will live, so long as Tenedos and Ida [223] shall stand; so long as Simois shall roll down to the sea his rapid waves. The Ascræan, too, [224] will live, so long as the grape shall swell with its juices; [225] so long as the corn shall fall, reaped by the curving sickle. The son of Battus [226] will to all time be sung throughout the whole world; although he is not powerful in genius, in his skill he shows his might. No mischance will _ever_ come to the _tragic_ buskin [227] of Sophocles; with the Sun and Moon Aratus [228] will ever exist. So long as the deceitful slave, [229] the harsh father, the roguish procuress, and the cozening courtesan shall endure, Menander will exist. Ennius, [230] without any _art_, and Accius, [231] with his spirited language, have a name that will perish with no lapse of time. What age is to be forgetful of Varro, [232] and the first ship _that sailed_, and of the golden fleece sought by the chief, the son of Æson? Then will the verses perish of the sublime Lucretius, [233] when the same day shall give the world to destruction. Tityrus, [234] and the harvests, and the arms of Æneas, will be read of, so long as thou, Rome, [235] shalt be the ruler of the conquered earth. So long as the flames and the bow shall be the arms of Cupid, thy numbers, polished Tibullus, [236] will be repeated. Gallus [237] _will be known_ by the West, and Gallus _known_ by the East, [238] and with Gallus will his Lycoris be known. Though flint-stones, then, _and_ though the share of the enduring plough perish by lapse of time, _yet_ poetry is exempt from death. Let monarchs and the triumphs of monarchs yield to poesy, and let the wealthy shores of the golden Tagus [239] yield. Let the vulgar throng admire worthless things; let the yellow-haired Apollo supply for me cups filled from the Castalian stream; let me bear, too, on my locks the myrtle that dreads the cold; and let me often be read by the anxious lover. Envy feeds upon the living; after death it is at rest, when his own reward protects each according to his merit. Still then, when the closing fire [240] shall have consumed me, shall I live on; and a great portion of myself will _ever_ be surviving. BOOK THE SECOND ELEGY I. _He says that he is obliged by Cupid to write of Love instead of the Wars, of the Giants, upon which subject he had already commenced._ |This work, also, I, Naso, born among the watery Peligni, [301] have composed, the Poet of my own failings. This work, too, has Love demanded. Afar hence, be afar hence, ye prudish matrons; you are not a fitting audience for my wanton lines. Let the maiden that is not cold, read me in the presence of her betrothed; the inexperienced boy, too, wounded by a passion hitherto unknown; and may some youth, now wounded by the bow by which I am, recognise the conscious symptoms of his flame; and after long wondering, may he exclaim, \"Taught by what informant, has this Poet been composing my own story?\" I was (I remember) venturing to sing of the battles of the heavens, and Gyges [302] with his hundred hands; and I had sufficient power of expression; what time the Earth so disgracefully avenged herself, and lofty Ossa, heaped upon Olympus, bore Pelion headlong downwards. Having the clouds in my hands, and wielding the lightnings with Jove, which with success he was to hurl in behalf of his realms of the heavens, my mistress shut her door against me; the lightnings together with Jove did I forsake.

Through verses have doors given way; and by verses [304] was the bar, inserted in the door-post, although 'twas made of oak, overcome. Of what use is the swift Achilles celebrated by me? What can this or that son of Atreus do for me? He, too, who wasted as many of his years in wandering as in warfare? And the wretched Hector, dragged by the Hæmonian steeds? But the charms of the beauteous fair being ofttimes sung, she presents herself to the Poet as the reward of his verse. This great recompense is given; farewell, then, ye illustrious names of heroes; your favour is of no use to me. Ye charming fair, turn your eyes to my lines, which blushing Cupid dictates to me. ELEGY II. _He has seen a lady walking in the portico of the temple of Apollo, and has sent to know if he may wait upon her. She has replied that it is quite impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her. Ovid here addresses Bagous, and endeavours to persuade him to relax his watch over the fair; and shows him how he can do so with safety._ |Bagous, [305] with whom is the duty of watching over your mistress, give me your attention, while I say a few but suitable words to you. Yesterday morning I saw a young lady walking in that portico which contains the choir _of the daughters_ of Danaus. [306] At once, as she pleased me, I sent _to her_, and in my letter I proffered my request; with trembling hand, she answered me, \"I cannot.\" And to my inquiry, why she could not, the cause was announced; _namely_, that your surveillance over your mistress is too strict. O keeper, if you are wise (believe me _now_), cease to deserve my hatred; every one wishes him gone, of whom he stands in dread. Her husband, too, is not in his senses; for who would toil at taking care of that of which no part is lost, even if you do not watch it? But _still_, in his madness, let him indulge his passion; and let him believe that the object is chaste which pleases universally. By your favour, liberty may by stealth be given to her; that _one day_ she may return to you what you have given her. Are you ready to be a confidant; the mistress is obedient to the slave. You fear to be an accomplice; you may shut your eyes. Does she read a letter by herself; suppose her mother to have sent it. Does a stranger come; bye and bye let him go, [307] _as though_ an _old_ acquaintance. Should she go to visit a sick female friend, who is not sick; in your opinion, let her be unwell. If she shall be a long time at the sacrifice, [308] let not the long waiting tire you; putting your head on your breast, you can snore away. And don't be enquiring what can be going on at _the temple of_ the linen-clad Isis; [309] nor do you stand in any fear _whatever_ of the curving theatres. An accomplice in the escapade will receive everlasting honour; and what is less trouble than _merely_ to hold your tongue? He is in favour; he turns the house [310] upside down _at his pleasure_, and he feels no stripes; he is omnipotent; the rest, a scrubby lot, are grovelling on. By him, that the real circumstances may be concealed, false ones are coined; and both the masters approve [311] of, what one, _and that the mistress_, Approves of. When the husband has quite contracted his brow, and has pursed up his wrinkles, the caressing fair makes him become just as she pleases. But still, let her sometimes contrive some fault against you even, and let her pretend tears, and call you an executioner. [312] Do you, on the other hand, making some charge which she may easily explain; by a feigned accusation remove all suspicion of the truth. [313] In such case, may your honours, then may your limited savings [314] increase; _only_ do this, and in a short time you shall be a free man. You behold the chains bound around the necks of informers; [315] the loathsome gaol receives the hearts that are unworthy of belief. In the midst of water Tantalus is in want of water, and catches at the apples as they escape him; 'twas his blabbing tongue caused this. [325] While the keeper appointed by Juno, [326] is watching Io too carefully, he dies before his time; she becomes a Goddess. I have seen him wearing fetters on his bruised legs, through whom a husband was obliged to know of an intrigue. The punishment was less than his deserts; an unruly tongue was the injury of the two; the husband was grieved; the female suffered the loss of her character", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-540d8a1b5f98027bff4df2b8e31b99b0", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "; 'twas his blabbing tongue caused this. [325] While the keeper appointed by Juno, [326] is watching Io too carefully, he dies before his time; she becomes a Goddess. I have seen him wearing fetters on his bruised legs, through whom a husband was obliged to know of an intrigue. The punishment was less than his deserts; an unruly tongue was the injury of the two; the husband was grieved; the female suffered the loss of her character. Believe me; accusations are pleasing to no husband, and no one do they delight, even though he should listen to them. If he is indifferent, then you are wasting your information upon ears that care nothing for it; if he dotes _on her_, by your officiousness is he made wretched. Besides, a faux pas, although discovered, is not so easily proved; she comes _before him_, protected by the prejudices of her judge. Should even he himself see it, still he himself will believe her as she denies it; and he will condemn his own eyesight, and will impose upon himself. Let him _but_ see the tears of his spouse, and he himself will weep, and he will say, \"That blabbing fellow shall be punished.\" How unequal the contest in which you embark! if conquered, stripes are ready for you; _while_ she is reposing in the bosom of the judge. No crime do we meditate; we meet not for mixing poisons; my hand is not glittering with the drawn sword. We ask that through you we may be enabled to love in safety; what can there be more harmless than these our prayers? ELEGY III. _He again addresses Bagous, who has proved obdurate to his request, and tries to effect his object by sympathising with his unhappy fate._ |Alas! that, [327] neither man nor woman, you are watching your mistress, and that you cannot experience the mutual transports of love! He who was the first to mutilate boys, [328] ought himself to have suffered those wounds which he made. You would be ready to accommodate, and obliging to those who entreat you, had your own passion been before inflamed by any fair. You were not born for _managing_ the steed, nor _are you_ skilful in valorous arms; for your right hand the warlike spear is not adapted. With these let males meddle; do you resign _all_ manly aspirations; may the standard be borne [329] by you in the cause of your mistress. Overwhelm her with your favours; her gratitude may be of use to you. If you should miss that, what good fortune will there be for you? She has both beauty, _and_ her years are fitted for dalliance; her charms are not deserving to fade in listless neglect. Ever watchful though you are deemed, _still_ she may deceive you; what two persons will, does not fail of accomplishment. Still, as it is more convenient to try you with our entreaties, we do implore you, while you have _still_ the opportunity of conferring your favours to advantage. [330] ELEGY IV. _He confesses that he is an universal admirer of the fair sex._ |I would not presume to defend my faulty morals, and to wield deceiving arms in behalf of my frailties. I confess them, if there is any use in confessing one's errors; and now, having confessed, I am foolishly proceeding to my own accusation. I hate _this state_; nor, though I wish, can I be otherwise than what I hate. Alas! how hard it is to bear _a lot_ which you wish to lay aside! For strength and self-control fail me for ruling myself; just like a ship carried along the rapid tide, am I hurried away. There is no single style of beauty which inflames my passion; there are a hundred causes for me always to be in love. Is there any fair one that casts down her modest eyes? I am on fire; and that very modesty becomes an ambush against me. Is another one forward; _then_ I am enchanted, because she is not coy; and her liveliness raises all my expectations. If another seems to be prudish, and to imitate the repulsive Sabine dames; [332] I think that she is kindly disposed, but that she conceals it in her stateliness. [333] Or if you are a learned fair, you please me, _thus_ endowed with rare acquirements; or if ignorant, you are charming for your simplicity. Is there one who says that the lines of Callimachus are uncouth in comparison with mine; at once she, to whom I am _so_ pleasing, pleases me. Is there even one who abuses both myself, the Poet, and my lines; I could wish to have her who so abuses me, upon my knee. Does this one walk leisurely, she enchants me with her gait; is another uncouth, still, she may become more gentle, on being more intimate with the other sex.

You, because you are so tall, equal the Heroines of old; [337] and, of large size, you can fill the entire couch as you lie. Another is active from her shortness; by both I am enchanted; both tall and short suit my taste. Is one unadorned; it occurs what addition there might be if she was adorned. Is one decked out; she sets out her endowments to advantage. The blonde will charm me; the brunette [338] will charm me _too_; a Venus is pleasing, even of a swarthy colour. Does black hair fall upon a neck of snow; Leda was sightly, with her raven locks. Is the hair flaxen; with her saffron locks, Aurora was charming. To every traditional story does my passion adapt itself. A youthful age charms me; _an age_ more mature captivates me; the former is superior in the charms of person, the latter excels in spirit. In fine, whatever the fair any person approves of in all the City, to all these does my passion aspire. ELEGY V. _He addresses his mistress, whom he has detected acting falsely towards him._ |Away with thee, quivered Cupid: no passion is of a value so great, that it should so often be my extreme wish to die. It is my wish to die, as oft as I call to mind your guilt. Fair one, born, alas! to be a never-ceasing cause of trouble! It is no tablets rubbed out [339] that discover your doings; no presents stealthily sent reveal your criminality. Oh! would that I might so accuse you, that, _after all_, I could not convict you! Ah wretched me! _and_ why is my case so stare? Happy _the man_ who boldly dares to defend the object which he loves; to whom his mistress is able to say, \"I have done nothing _wrong_.\" Hard-hearted _is he_, and too much does he encourage his own grief, by whom a blood-stained victory is sought in the conviction of the accused. To my sorrow, in my sober moments, with the wine on table, [342] I myself was witness of your criminality, when you thought I was asleep. I saw you _both_ uttering many an expression by moving your eyebrows; [343] in your nods there was a considerable amount of language. Your eyes were not silent, [344] the table, too, traced over with wine; [345] nor was the language of the fingers wanting; I understood your discourse, [346] which treated of that which it did not appear to do; the words, too, preconcerted to stand for certain meanings. And now, the tables removed, many a guest had gone away; a couple of youths _only_ were _there_ dead drunk. But then I saw you _both_ giving wanton kisses; I am sure that there was billing enough on your part; such, _in fact_, as no sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but _rather such_ as some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may suppose that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time save to her own _dear_ Mars. \"What are you doing?\" I cried out; \"whither are you taking those transports that belong to me? On what belongs to myself, I will lay the hand of a master, [347] These _delights_ must be in common with you and me, _and_ with me and you; _but_ why does any third person take a share in them?\" This did I say; and what, _besides_, sorrow prompted my tongue to say; but the red blush of shame rose on her conscious features; just as the sky, streaked by the wife of Tithonus, is tinted with red, or the maiden when beheld by her new-made husband; [348] just as the roses are beauteous when mingled among their _encircling_ lilies; or when the Moon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; [349] or the Assyrian ivory [350] which the Mæonian woman has stained, [351] that from length of time it may not turn yellow. That complexion _of hers_ was extremely like to these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never was more beauteous _than then_. She looked towards the ground; to look upon the ground, added a charm; sad were her features, in her sorrow was she graceful. I had been tempted to tear her locks just as they were, (and nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender cheeks. When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of her own was my mistress defended. I, who the moment before had been so savage, _now_, as a suppliant and of my own accord, entreated that she would give me kisses not inferior _to those given-to my rival_. She smiled, and with heartiness she gave me her best _kisses_; such as might have snatched his three-forked bolts from Jove. To my misery I am _now_ tormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and I hope", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-3acd5a0f264338faea85dbb5eea34f00", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "defended.

[352] Those _kisses,_ too, were far better than those which I taught her; and she seemed to have learned something new. That they were too delightful, is a bad sign; that so lovingly were your lips joined to mine, _and_ mine to yours. And yet, it is not at this alone that I am grieved; I do not only complain that kisses were given; although I do complain as well that they were given; such could never have been taught but on a closer acquaintanceship. I know not who is the master that has received a remuneration so ample. ELEGY VI. _He laments the death of the parrot which he had given to Corinna._ |The parrot, the imitative bird [353] sent from the Indians of the East, is dead; come in flocks to his obsequies, ye birds. Come, affectionate denizens of air, and beat your breasts with your wings; and with your hard claws disfigure your delicate features. Let your rough feathers be torn in place of your sorrowing hair; instead of the long trumpet, [354] let your songs resound. Why, Philomela, are you complaining of the cruelty of _Tereus,_ the Ismarian tyrant? _Surely,_ that grievance is worn out by its _length of_ years. Turn your attention to the sad end of a bird so prized. It is is a great cause of sorrow, but, _still,_ that so old. All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord. See, the quails, amid _all_ their battles, [363] live on; perhaps, too, for that reason, they become old. With a very little you were satisfied; and, through your love of talking, you could not give time to your mouth for much food. A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of sleep; and a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst. The gluttonous vulture lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and the jackdaw, the foreboder [364] of the shower of rain. The crow, too, lives on, hateful to the armed Minerva; [366] it, indeed, will hardly die after nine ages. [367] The prattling parrot is dead, the mimic of the human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth. What is best, is generally first carried off by greedy hands; what is worthless, fills its _destined_ numbers. [368] Thersites was the witness of the lamented death of him from Phylax; and now Hector became ashes, while his brothers _yet_ lived. Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind? The seventh day was come, [369] that was doomed to give no morrow; and now stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered. And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate.

I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress, who suspects the contrary, that he is not in love with her handmaid Cypassis._ |Am I then [378] 'to be for ever made the object of accusation by new charges? Though I should conquer, _yet_ I am tired of entering the combat so oft. Do I look up to the _very_ top of the marble theatre, from the multitude, you choose some woman, from whom to receive a cause of grief. Or does some beauteous fair look on me with inexpressive features; you find out that there are secret signs on the features. Do I praise any one; with your nails you attack her ill-starred locks; if I blame any one, you think I am hiding some fault. If my colour is healthy, _then I am pronounced_ to be indifferent towards you; if unhealthy, _then_ I am said to be dying with love for another. But I _only_ wish I was conscious to myself of some fault; those endure punishment with equanimity, who are deserving of it. Now you accuse me without cause; and by believing every thing at random, you yourself forbid your anger to be of any consequence. See how the long-eared ass, [379] in his wretched lot, walks leisurely along, _although_ tyrannized over with everlasting blows. _And_ lo! a fresh charge; Cypassis, so skilled at tiring, [380] is blamed for having been the supplanter of her mistress. May the Gods prove more favourable, than that if I should have any inclination for a faux pas, a low-born mistress of a despised class should attract me! What free man would wish to have amorous intercourse with a bondwoman, and to embrace a body mangled with the whip? [387] Add, _too_, that she is skilled in arranging your hair, and is a valuable servant to you for the skill of her hands. And would I, forsooth, ask _such a thing_ of a servant, who is so faithful to you? _And_ for why? Only that a refusal might be united to a betrayal? I swear by Venus, and by the bow of the winged boy, that I am accused of a crime which I never committed. ELEGY VIII. _He wonders how Corinna has discovered his intrigue with Cypassis, her handmaid, and tells the latter how ably he has defended her and himself to her mistress._ |Cypassis, perfect in arranging the hair in a thousand fashions, but deserving to adorn the Goddesses alone; discovered, too, by me, in our delightful intrigue, to be no novice; useful, indeed, to your mistress, but still more serviceable to myself; who, _I wonder_, was the informant of our stolen caresses? \"Whence was Corinna made acquainted with your escapade? Is it that I have blushed? Is it that, making a slip in any expression, I have given any guilty sign of our stealthy amours? And have I _not_, too, declared that if any one can commit the sin with a bondwoman, that man must want a sound mind? The Thessalian was inflamed by the beauty of the captive daughter of Brises; the slave priestess of Phoebus was beloved by the general from Mycenæ. I am not greater than the descendant of Tantalus, nor greater than Achilles; why should I deem that a disgrace to me, which was becoming for monarchs? But when she fixed her angry eyes upon you, I saw you blushing all over your cheeks. But, if, perchance, you remember, with how much more presence of mind did I myself make oath by the great Godhead of Venus! Do thou, Goddess, do thou order the warm South winds to bear away over the Carpathian ocean [388] the perjuries of a mind unsullied. In return for these services, swarthy Cypassis, [389] give me a sweet reward, your company to-day. Why refuse me, ungrateful one, and why invent new apprehensions? 'Tis enough to have laid one of your superiors under an obligation. But if, in your folly, you refuse me, as the informer, I will tell what has taken place before; and I myself will be the betrayer of my own failing. And I will tell Cypassis, in what spots I have met you, and how often, and in ways how many and what. ELEGY IX. _To Cupid._ O Cupid, never angered enough against me, O boy, that hast taken up thy abode in my heart! why dost thou torment me, who, _thy_ soldier, have never deserted thy standards? And _why_, in my own camp, am I _thus_ wounded? Why does thy torch burn, thy bow pierce, thy friends? 'Twere a greater glory to conquer those who war _with thee_. Nay more, did not the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his healing aid, whom he had struck with his spear.

Nay more, did not the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his healing aid, whom he had struck with his spear. [390] The hunter follows _the prey_ that flies, that which is caught he leaves behind; and he is ever on the search for still more than he has found. We, a multitude devoted to thee, are _too well_ acquainted with thy arms; _yet_ thy tardy hand slackens against the foe that resists. Of what use is it to be blunting thy barbed darts against bare bones? _for_ Love has left my bones _quite_ bare. Many a man is there free from Love, many a damsel, too, free from Love; from these, with great glory, may a triumph be obtained by thee. Rome, had she not displayed her strength over the boundless earth, would, even to this day, have been planted thick with cottages of thatch. [391] The invalid soldier is drafted off to the fields [392] that he has received; the horse, when free from the race, [393] is sent into the pastures; the lengthened docks conceal the ship laid up; and the wand of repose [394] is demanded, the sword laid by. It were time for me, too, who have served so oft in love for the fair, now discharged, to be living in quiet. _And yet_, if any Divinity were to say to me, 'Live on, resigning love I should decline it; so sweet an evil are the fair. When I am quite exhausted, and the passion has faded from my mind, I know not by what perturbation of my wretched feelings I am bewildered. Just as the horse that is hard of mouth bears his master headlong, as he vainly pulls in the reins covered with foam; just as a sudden gale, the land now nearly made, carries out to sea the vessel, as she is entering harbour; so, many a time, does the uncertain gale of Cupid bear me away, and rosy Love resumes his well-known weapons. Pierce me, boy; naked am I exposed to thee, my arms laid aside; hither let thy strength be _directed_: here thy right hand tells _with effect_. Here, as though bidden, do thy arrows now spontaneously come; in comparison to myself, their own quiver is hardly so well known to them. Wretched is he who endures to rest the whole night, and who calls slumber a great good. Fool, what is slumber but the image of cold death? The Fates will give abundance of time for taking rest. Only let the words of my deceiving mistress beguile me; in hoping, at least, great joys shall I experience. And sometimes let her use caresses; sometimes let her find fault; oft may I enjoy _the favour_ of my mistress; often may I be repulsed. That Mars is one so dubious, is through thee, his step-son, Cupid; and after thy example does thy step-father wield his arms. Thou art fickle, and much more wavering than thy own wings; and thou both dost give and refuse thy joys at thy uncertain caprice. Still if thou dost listen to me, as I entreat thee, with thy beauteous mother; hold a sway never to be relinquished in my heart. May the damsels, a throng too flighty _by far_, be added to thy realms; then by two peoples wilt thou be revered. ELEGY X. _He tells Græcinus how he is in love with two mistresses at the same time._ |Thou wast wont to tell me, Græcinus [395] (I remember well), 'twas thou, I am sure, that a person cannot be in love with two females at the same time. Through thee have I been deceived; through thee have I been caught without my arms. [396] Lo! to my shame, I am in love with two at the same moment. Both of them are charming; both most attentive to their dress; in skill, 'tis a matter of doubt, whether the one or the other is superior. That one is more beauteous than this; this one, too, is more beauteous than that; and this one pleases me the most, and that one the most. The one passion and the other fluctuate, like the skiff, [397] impelled by the discordant breezes, and keep me distracted. Why, Erycina, dost thou everlastingly double my pangs? Was not one damsel sufficient for my anxiety? Why add leaves to the trees, why stars to the heavens filled _with them?_ Why additional waters to the vast ocean? But still this is better, than if I were languishing without a flame; may a life of seriousness be the lot of my foes. May it be the lot of my foes to sleep in the couch of solitude, and to recline their limbs outstretched in the midst of the bed.

But, for me, may cruel Love _ever_ disturb my sluggish slumbers; and may I be not the solitary burden of my couch. May my mistress, with no one to hinder it, make me die _with love_, if one is enough to be able to do so; _but_ if one is not enough, _then_ two. Limbs that are thin, [401] but not without strength, may suffice; flesh it is, not sinew that my body is in want of. Delight, too, will give resources for vigour to my sides; through me has no fair ever been deceived. Often, robust through the hours of delicious night, have I proved of stalwart body, even in the mom. Happy the man, who proves the delights of Love? Oh that the Gods would grant that to be the cause of my end! Let the soldier arm his breast [402] that faces the opposing darts, and with his blood let him purchase eternal fame. Let the greedy man seek wealth; and with forsworn mouth, let the shipwrecked man drink of the seas which he has wearied with ploughing them. But may it be my lot to perish in the service of Love: _and_, when I die, may I depart in the midst of his battles; [403] and may some one say, when weeping at my funeral rites: \"Such was a fitting death for his life.\" ELEGY XI. _He endeavours to dissuade Corinna from her voyage to Baiæ._ |The pine, cut on the heights of Pelion, was the first to teach the voyage full of danger, as the waves of the ocean wondered: which, boldly amid the meeting rocks, [404] bore away the ram remarkable for his yellow fleece. Oh! would that, overwhelmed, the Argo had drunk of the fatal waves, so that no one might plough the wide main with the oar. Lo! Corinna flies from both the well-known couch, and the Penates of her home, and prepares to go upon the deceitful paths _of the ocean_. Ah wretched me! why, for you, must I dread the Zephyrs, and the Eastern gales, and the cold Boreas, and the warm wind of the South? There no cities will you admire, _there_ no groves; _ever_ the same is the azure appearance of the perfidious main. The midst of the ocean has no tiny shells, or tinted pebbles; [405] that is the recreation [406] of the sandy shore. The shore _alone_, ye fair, should be pressed with your marble feet. Thus far is it safe; the rest of _that_ path is full of hazard. And let others tell you of the warfare of the winds: the waves which Scylla infests, or those which Charybdis _haunts_: from what rocky range the deadly Ceraunia projects: in what gulf the Syrtes, or in what Malea [407] lies concealed. Of these let others tell: but do you believe what each of them relates: no storm injures the person who credits them. After a length of time _only_ is the land beheld once more, when, the cable loosened, the curving ship runs out upon the boundless main: where the anxious sailor dreads the stormy winds, and _sees_ death as near him, as he sees the waves. What if Triton arouses the agitated waves? How parts the colour, then, from all your face! Then you may invoke the gracious stars of the fruitful Leda: [409] and may say, 'Happy she, whom her own _dry_ land receives!'Tis far more safe to lie snug in the couch, [410] to read amusing books, [411] _and_ to sound with one's fingers the Thracian lyre. But if the headlong gales bear away my unavailing words, still may Galatea be propitious to your ship. The loss of such a damsel, both ye Goddesses, daughters of Nereus, and thou, father of the Nereids, would be a reproach to you. Go, mindful of me, on your way, _soon_ to return with favouring breezes: may that, a stronger gale, fill your sails. Then may the mighty Nereus roll the ocean towards this shore: in this direction may the breezes blow: hither may the tide impel the waves. Do you yourself entreat, that the Zephyrs may come full upon your canvass: do you let out the swelling sails with your own hand. I shall be the first, from the shore, to see the well-known ship, and I shall exclaim, \"'Tis she that carries my Divinities: [412] and I will receive you in my arms, and will ravish, indiscriminately, many a kiss; the victim, promised for your return, shall fall; the soft sand shall be heaped, too, in the form of a couch; and some sand-heap shall be as a table [413] _for us_. There, with wine placed before us, you shall tell many a story, how your bark was nearly overwhelmed in the midst of the waves: and how, while you were hastening to me, you dreaded neither the hours of the dangerous night, nor yet the stormy Southern gales. Though they be fictions, [414] _yet_ all will I believe as truth; why should I not myself encourage what is my own wish? May Lucifer, the most brilliant in the lofty skies, speedily bring me that day, spurring on his steed.\" ELEGY XII. _", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e1210480b5c05b18ce59cb21e5b063e4", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "overwhelmed in the midst of the waves: and how, while you were hastening to me, you dreaded neither the hours of the dangerous night, nor yet the stormy Southern gales.

May Lucifer, the most brilliant in the lofty skies, speedily bring me that day, spurring on his steed.\" ELEGY XII. _He rejoices in the possession of his mistress, having triumphed over every obstacle._ |Come, triumphant laurels, around my temples; I am victorious: lo! in my bosom Corinna is; she, whom her husband, whom a keeper, whom a door _so_ strong, (so many foes!) were watching, that she might by no stratagem be taken. This victory is deserving of an especial triumph: in which the prize, such as it is, is _gained_ without bloodshed. Not lowly walls, not towns surrounded with diminutive trenches, but a _fair_ damsel has been taken by my contrivance. When Pergamus fell, conquered in a war of twice five years: [415] out of so many, how great was the share of renown for the son of Atreus? But my glory is undivided, and shared in by no soldier: and no other has the credit of the exploit. Myself the general, myself the troops, I have attained this end of my desires: I, myself, have been the cavalry, I the infantry, I, the standard-bearer _too_. Fortune, too, has mingled no hazard with my feats. Come hither, _then_, thou Triumph, gained by exertions _entirely_ my own. And the cause [416] of my warfare is no new one; had not the daughter of Tyndarus been carried off, there would have been peace between Europe and Asia. A female disgracefully set the wild Lapithæ and the two-formed race in arms, when the wine circulated. A female again, [417] good Latinus, forced the Trojans to engage in ruthless warfare, in thy realms. 'Twas the females, [421] when even now the City was but new, that sent against the Romans their fathers-in-law, and gave them cruel arms. I have beheld the bulls fighting for a snow-white mate: the heifer, herself the spectator, afforded fresh courage. Me, too, with many others, but still without bloodshed, has Cupid ordered to bear the standard in his service. ELEGY XIII. _He entreats the aid of Isis and Lucina in behalf of Corinna, in her labour._ |While Corinna, in her imprudence, is trying to disengage the burden of her pregnant womb, exhausted, she lies prostrate in danger of her life. She, in truth, who incurred so great a risk unknown to me, is worthy of my wrath; but anger falls before apprehension. But yet, by me it was that she conceived; or so I think. That is often as a fact to me, which is possible. Isis, thou who dost [422] inhabit Parætonium, [423] and the genial fields of Canopus, [424] and Memphis, [425] and palm-bearing Pharos, [426] and where the rapid. Nile, discharged from its vast bed, rushes through its seven channels into the ocean waves; by thy 'sistra' [428] do I entreat thee; by the faces, _too_, of revered Anubis; [429] and then may the benignant Osiris [430] ever love thy rites, and may the sluggish serpent [431] ever wreath around thy altars, and may the horned Apis [432] walk in the procession as thy attendant; turn hither thy features, [433] and in one have mercy upon two; for to my mistress wilt thou be giving life, she to me. Full many a time in thy honour has she sat on thy appointed days, [434] on which [435] the throng of the Galli [436] wreathe _themselves_ with thy laurels. [437] Thou, too, who dost have compassion on the females who are in labour, whose latent burden distends their bodies slowly moving; come, propitious Ilithyia, [438] and listen to my prayers. She is worthy for thee to command to become indebted to thee. I, myself, in white array, will offer frankincense at thy smoking altars; I, myself, will offer before thy feet the gifts that I have vowed. I will add _this_ inscription too; \"Naso, for the preservation of Corinna, _offers these_.\" But if, amid apprehensions so great, I may be allowed to give you advice, let it suffice for you, Corinna, to have struggled in this _one_ combat. ELEGY XIV. _He reproaches his mistress for having attempted to procure abortion._ |Of what use is it for damsels to live at ease, exempt from war, and not with their bucklers, [439] to have any inclination to follow the bloodstained troops; if, without warfare, they endure wounds from weapons of their own, and arm their imprudent hands for their own destruction?

She who was the first to teach how to destroy the tender embryo, was deserving to perish by those arms of her own. That the stomach, forsooth, may be without the reproach of wrinkles, the sand must [440] be lamentably strewed for this struggle of yours. If the same custom had pleased the matrons of old, through _such_ criminality mankind would have perished; and he would be required, who should again throw stones [441] on the empty earth, for the second time the original of our kind. Who would have destroyed the resources of Priam, if Thetis, the Goddess of the waves, had refused to bear _Achilles_, her due burden? If Ilia had destroyed [442] the twins in her swelling womb, the founder of the all-ruling City would have perished. If Venus had laid violent hands on Æneas in her pregnant womb, the earth would have been destitute of _its_ Cæsars. You, too, beauteous one, might have died at the moment you might have been born, if your mother had tried the same experiment which you have done. I, myself, though destined as I am, to die a more pleasing death by love, should have beheld no days, had my mother slain me. Why do you deprive the loaded vine of its growing grapes? And why pluck the sour apples with relentless hand? When ripe, let them fall of their own accord; _once_ put forth, let them grow. Life is no slight reward for a little waiting. Why pierce [443] your own entrails, by applying instruments, and _why_ give dreadful poisons to the _yet_ unborn? People blame the Colchian damsel, stained with the blood of her sons; and they grieve for Itys, Slaughtered by his own mother. Each mother was cruel; but each, for sad reasons, took vengeance on her husband, by shedding their common blood. Tell me what Tereus, or what Jason excites you to pierce your body with an anxious hand? This neither the tigers do in their Armenian dens, [444] nor does the lioness dare to destroy an offspring of her own. But, delicate females do this, not, however, with impunity; many a time [445] does she die herself, who kills her _offspring_ in the womb. She dies herself, and, with her loosened hair, is borne upon the bier; and those whoever only catch a sight of her, cry \"She deserved it.\" [446] But let these words vanish in the air of the heavens, and may there be no weight in _these_ presages of mine. Ye forgiving Deities, allow her this once to do wrong with safety _to herself_; that is enough; let a second transgression bring _its own_ punishment. ELEGY XV. _He addresses a ring which he has presented to his mistress, and envi its happy lot._ |O ring, [447] about to encircle the finger of the beauteous fair, in which there is nothing of value but the affection of the giver; go as a pleasing gift; _and_ receiving you with joyous feelings, may she at once place you upon her finger. May you serve her as well as she is constant to me; and nicely fitting, may you embrace her finger in your easy circle. Happy ring, by my mistress will you be handled. To my sorrow, I am now envying my own presents. O! that I could suddenly be changed into my own present, by the arts of her of Ææa, or of the Carpathian old man! [448] Then could I wish you to touch the bosom of my mistress, and for her to place her left hand within her dress. Though light and fitting well, I would escape from her finger; and loosened by _some_ wondrous contrivance, into her bosom would I fall. I too, _as well_, that I might be able to seal [449] her secret tablets, and that the seal, neither sticky nor dry, might not drag the wax, should first have to touch the lips [450] of the charming fair. Only I would not seal a note, the cause of grief to myself. Should I be given, to be put away in her desk, [459] I would refuse to depart, sticking fast to your fingers with ray contracted circle. To you, my life, I would never be a cause of disgrace, or a burden which your delicate fingers would refuse to carry. Wear me, when you are bathing your limbs in the tepid stream; and put up with the inconvenience of the water getting beneath the stone. But, I doubt, that _on seeing you_ naked, my passion would be aroused; and that, a ring, I should enact the part of the lover. _But_ why wish for impossibilities? Go, my little gift; let her understand that my constancy is proffered with you. ELEGY XVI. _He enlarges on the beauties of his native place, where he is now staying; but, notwithstanding the delights of the country, he says that he cannot feel happy in the absence of his mistress, whom he invites to visit him._ |Sulmo, [460] the third part of the Pelignian land, [461] _now_ receives me; a little spot, but salubrious with its flowing streams.

Though the Sun should cleave the earth with his approaching rays, and though the oppressive Constellation [462] of the Dog of Icarus should shine, the Pelignian fields are traversed by flowing streams, and the shooting grass is verdant on the soft ground. The earth is fertile in corn, and much more fruitful in the grape; the thin soil [463] produces, too, the olive, that bears its berries. [464] The rivers also trickling amid the shooting blades, the grassy turfs cover the moistened ground. But my flame is far away. In one word, I am mistaken; she who excites my flame is far off; my flame is here. I would not choose, could I be placed between Pollux and Castor, to be in a portion of the heavens without yourself. Let them lie with their anxious cares, and let them be pressed with the heavy weight of the earth, who have measured out the earth into lengthened tracks. [465] Or else they should have bid the fair to go as the companions of the youths, if the earth must be measured out into lengthened tracks. Then, had I, shivering, had to pace the stormy Alps, [466] the journey would have been pleasant, so that _I had been_ with my love. With my love, I could venture to rush through the Libyan quicksands, and to spread my sails to be borne along by the fitful Southern gales. _Then_, I would not dread the monsters which bark beneath the thigh of the virgin _Scylla_; nor winding Malea, thy bays; nor where Charybdis, sated with ships swallowed up, disgorges them, and sucks up again the water which she has discharged. And if the sway of the winds prevails, and the waves bear away the Deities about to come to our aid; do you throw your snow-white arms around my shoulders; with active body will I support the beauteous burden. The youth who visited Hero, had often swam across the waves; then, too, would he have crossed them, but the way was dark. But without you, although the fields affording employment with their vines detain me; although the meadows be overflowed by the streams, and _though_ the husbandman invite the obedient stream [467] into channels, and the cool air refresh the foliage of the trees, I should not seem to be among the healthy Peliguians; I _should_ not _seem to be in_ the place of my birth--my paternal fields; but in Scythia, and among the fierce Cilicians, [468] and the Britons _painted_ green, [469] and the rocks which are red with the gore of Prometheus. The elm loves the vine, [471] the vine forsakes not the elm: why am I _so_ often torn away from my love? But you used to swear, _both_ by myself, and by your eyes, my stars, that you would ever be my companion. The winds and the waves carry away, whither they choose, the empty words of the fair, more worthless than the falling leaves. Still, if there is any affectionate regard in you for me _thus_ deserted: _now_ commence to add deeds to your promises: and forthwith do you, as the nags [472] whirl your little chaise [473] along, shake the reins over their manes at full speed. But you, rugged hills, subside, wherever she shall come; and you paths in the winding vales, be smooth. ELEGY XVII. _He says that he is the slave of Corinna, and complains of the tyranny which she exercises over him._ |If there shall be any one who thinks it inglorious to serve a damsel: in his opinion I shall be convicted of such baseness. Let me be disgraced; if only she, who possesses Paphos, and Cythera, beaten by the waves, torments me with less violence. And would that I had been the prize, too, of some indulgent mistress; since I was destined to be the prize of some fair. Beauty begets pride; through her charms Corinna is disdainful. Ah wretched me! why is she so well known to herself? Pride, forsooth, is caught from the reflection of the mirror: and _there_ she sees not herself, unless she is first adorned. If your beauty gives you a sway not too great over all things, face born to fascinate my eyes, still, you ought not, on that account, to despise me comparatively with yourself. That which is inferior must be united with what is great. The Nymph Calypso, seized with passion for a mortal, is believed to have detained the hero against his will. It is believed that the ocean-daughter of Nereus was united to the king of Plithia, [474] _and_ that Egeria was to the just Numa: that Venus was to Vulcan: although, his anvil [475] left, he limped with a distorted foot.

May it become you to impose conditions in the midst of your caresses. I will be no disgrace to you, nor one for you to rejoice at my removal. This affection will not be one to be disavowed by you. [477] May my cheerful lines be to you in place of great wealth: even many a fair wishes to gain fame through me. I know of one who publishes it that she is Corinna. [478] What would she not be ready to give to be so? But neither do the cool Eurotas, and the poplar-bearing Padus, far asunder, roll along the same banks; nor shall any one but yourself be celebrated in my poems. You, alone, shall afford subject-matter for my genius. ELEGY XVIII. _He tells Macer that he ought to write on Love._ |While thou art tracing thy poem onwards [479] to the wrath of Achilles, and art giving their first arms to the heroes, after taking the oaths; I, Macer, [480] am reposing in the shade of Venus, unused to toil; and tender Love attacks me, when about to attempt a mighty subject. Many a time have I said to my mistress, \"At length, away with you:\" _and_ forthwith she has seated herself in my lap. Many a time have I said, \"I am ashamed _of myself:\" when,_ with difficulty, her tears repressed, she has said, \"Ah wretched me! Now you are ashamed to love.\" And _then_ she has thrown her arms around my neck: and has given me a thousand kisses, which _quite_ overpowered me. I am overcome: and my genius is called away from the arms it has assumed; and I _forthwith_ sing the exploits of my home, and my own warfare. Still did I wield the sceptre: and by my care my Tragedy grew apace; [481] and for this pursuit I was well prepared. Love smiled both at my tragic pall, and my coloured buskins, and the sceptre wielded so well by a private hand. From this pursuit, too, did the influence of my cruel mistress draw me away, and Love triumphed over the Poet with his buskins. As I am allowed _to do_, either I teach the art of tender love, (alas! by my own precepts am I myself tormented:) or I write what was delivered to Ulysses in the words of Penelope, or thy tears, deserted Phyllis. What, _too_, Paris and Macareus, and the ungrateful Jason, and the parent of Hip-polytus, and Hippolytus _himself_ read: and what the wretched Dido says, brandishing the drawn sword, and what the Lesbian mistress of the Æolian lyre. How swiftly did my friend, Sabinus, return [482] from all quarters of the world, and bring back letters [483] from different spots! The fair Penelope recognized the seal of Ulysses: the stepmother read what was written by her own Hippolytus. Then did the dutiful Æneas write an answer to the afflicted Elissa; and Phyllis, if she only survives, has something to read. The sad letter came to Hypsipyle from Jason: the Lesbian damsel, beloved _by Apollo_, may give the lyre that she has vowed to Phoebus. [484] Nor, Macer, so far as it is safe for a poet who sings of wars, is beauteous Love unsung of by thee, in the midst of warfare. Both Paris is there, and the adultress, the far-famed cause of guilt: and Laodamia, who attends her husband in death. If well I know thee; thou singest not of wars with greater pleasure than these; and from thy own camp thou comest back to mine. ELEGY XIX. _He tells a husband who does not care for his wife to watch her a little more carefully._ |If, fool, thou dost not need the fair to be well watched; still have her watched for my sake: that I may be pleased with her the more. What one may have is worthless; what one may not have, gives the more edge to the desires. If a man falls in love with that which another permits him _to love_, he is a man without feeling. Let us that love, both hope and fear in equal degree; and let an occasional repulse make room for our desires. Why should I _think of_ Fortune, should she never care to deceive me? I value nothing that does not sometimes cause me pain. The clever Corinna saw this failing in me; and she cunningly found out the means by which I might be enthralled. Oh, how many a time, feigning a pain in her head [485] that was quite well, has she ordered me, as I lingered with tardy foot, to take my departure! Oh, how many a time has she feigned a fault, and guilty _herself,_ has made there to be an appearance of innocence, just as she pleased! When thus she had tormented me and had rekindled the languid flame, again was she kind and obliging to my wishes. What caresses, what delightful words did she have ready for me! What kisses, ye great Gods, and how many, used she to give me!", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d64ce64b0a51b17a08eb9a938fb755d2", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "foot, to take my departure! Oh, how many a time has she feigned a fault, and guilty _herself,_ has made there to be an appearance of innocence, just as she pleased! When thus she had tormented me and had rekindled the languid flame, again was she kind and obliging to my wishes. What caresses, what delightful words did she have ready for me! What kisses, ye great Gods, and how many, used she to give me! You, too, who have so lately ravished my eyes, often stand in dread of treachery, often, when entreated, refuse; and let me, lying prostrate on the threshold before your door-posts, endure the prolonged cold throughout the frosty night. Thus is my love made lasting, and it grows up in lengthened experience; this is for my advantage, this forms food for my affection. A surfeit of love, [486] and facilities too great, become a cause of weariness to me, just as sweet food cloys the appetite. If the brazen tower had never enclosed Danaë, [487] Danaë had never been made a mother by Jove. While Juno is watching Io 'with her curving horns, she becomes still more pleasing to Jove than she has been _before_. Whoever desires what he may have, and what is easily obtained, let him pluck leaves from the trees, and take water from the ample stream. If any damsel wishes long to hold her sway, let her play with her lover. Alas! that I, myself, am tormented through my own advice. Let _constant_ indulgence be the lot of whom it may, it does injury to me: that which pursues, _from it_ I fly; that which flies, I ever pursue. But do thou, too sure of the beauteous fair, begin now at nightfall to close thy house. Begin to enquire who it is that so often stealthily paces thy threshold? Why, _too_, the dogs bark [488] in the silent night. Whither the careful handmaid is carrying, or whence bringing back, the tablets? Why so oft she lies in her couch apart? Let this anxiety sometimes gnaw into thy very marrow; and give some scope and some opportunity for my stratagems. If one could fall in love with the wife of a fool, that man could rob the barren sea-shore of its sand. And now I give thee notice; unless thou begin to watch this fair, she shall begin to cease to be a flame of mine. I have put up with much, and that for a long time; I have often hoped that it would come to pass, that I should adroitly deceive thee, when thou hadst watched her well. Thou art careless, and dost endure what should be endured by no husband; but an end there shall be of an amour that is allowed to me. And shall I then, to my sorrow, forsooth, never be forbidden admission? Will it ever be night for me, with no one for an avenger? Am I to dread nothing? Shall I heave no sighs in my sleep? What have I to do with one so easy, what with such a pander of a husband? By thy own faultiness thou dost mar my joys. Why, then, dost thou not choose some one else, for so great long-suffering to please? If it pleases thee for me to be thy rival, forbid me _to be so_.---- BOOK THE THIRD. ELEGY I. _The Poet deliberates whether he shall continue to write Elegies, or whether he shall turn to Tragedy._ |There stands an ancient grove, and one uncut for many a year; 'tis worthy of belief that a Deity inhabits that spot. In the midst there is a holy spring, and a grotto arched with pumice; and on every side the birds pour forth their sweet complaints. Here, as I was walking, protected by the shade of the trees, I was considering upon what work my Muse should commence. Elegy came up, having her perfumed hair wreathed; and, if I mistake not, one of her feet was longer _than the other_. [501] Her figure was beauteous; her robe of the humblest texture, her garb that of one in love; the fault of her foot was one cause of her gracefulness. Ruthless Tragedy, too, came with her mighty stride; on her scowling brow were her locks; her pall swept the ground. Her left hand held aloft the royal sceptre; the Lydian buskin [502] was the high sandal for her feet. And first she spoke; \"And when will there be an end of thy loving? O Poet, so slow at thy subject matter! Drunken revels [503] tell of thy wanton course of life; the cross roads, as they divide in their many ways, tell of it. Many a time does a person point with his finger at the Poet as he goes along, and say, 'That, that is the man whom cruel Love torments.' Thou art talked of as the story of the whole City, and yet thou dost not perceive it; while, all shame laid aside, thou art boasting of thy feats. 'Twere time to be influenced, touched by a more mighty inspiration; [505] long enough hast thou delayed; commence a greater task.

'Twere time to be influenced, touched by a more mighty inspiration; [505] long enough hast thou delayed; commence a greater task. By thy subject thou dost cramp thy genius; sing of the exploits of heroes; then thou wilt say, 'This is the field that is worthy of my genius.' Thy Muse has sportively indited what the charming fair may sing; and thy early youth has been passed amidst its own numbers. Now may I, Roman Tragedy, gain a celebrity by thy means; thy conceptions will satisfy my requirements.\" Thus far _did she speak_; and, supported on her tinted buskins, three or four times she shook her head with its flowing locks. The other one, if rightly I remember, smiled with eyes askance. Am I mistaken, or was there a branch of myrtle in her right hand? \"Why, haughty Tragedy,\" said she, \"dost thou attack me with high-sounding words? And canst thou never be other than severe? Still, thou thyself hast deigned to be excited in unequal numbers! [506] Against me hast thou strived, making use of my own verse. I should not compare heroic measures with my own; thy palaces quite overwhelm my humble abodes. I am a trifler; and with myself, Cupid, my care, is a trifler too; I am no more substantial myself than is my subject-matter. Without myself, the mother of wanton Love were coy; of that Goddess do I show myself the patroness [507] and the confidant. The door which thou with thy rigid buskin canst not unlock, the same is open to my caressing words. And yet I have deserved more power than thou, by putting up with many a thing that would not have been endured by thy haughtiness. \"Through me Corinna learned how, deceiving her keeper, to shake the constancy of the fastened door, [508] and to slip away from her couch, clad in a loose tunic, [509] and in the night to move her feet without a stumble. Or how often, cut in _the wood_, [510] have I been hanging up at her obdurate doors, not fearing to be read by the people as they passed! I remember besides, how, when sent, I have been concealed in the bosom of the handmaid, until the strict keeper had taken his departure. Still further--when thou didst send me as a present on her birthday [511] --but she tore me to pieces, and barbarously threw me in the water close by. I was the first to cause the prospering germs of thy genius to shoot; it has, as my gift, that for which she is now asking thee.\" They had now ceased; on which I began: \"By your own selves, I conjure you both; let my words, as I tremble, be received by unprejudiced ears. Thou, the one, dost grace me with the sceptre and the lofty buskin; already, even by thy contact with my lips, have I spoken in mighty accents. Thou, the other, dost offer a lasting fame to my loves; be propitious, then, and with the long lines unite the short. \"Do, Tragedy, grant a little respite to the Poet. Thou art an everlasting task; the time which she demands is but short.\" Moved by my entreaties, she gave me leave; let tender Love be sketched with hurried hand, while still there is time; from behind [514] a more weighty undertaking presses on. ELEGY II. _To his mistress, in whose company he is present at the chariot races in the Circus Maximus. He describes the race._ |I am not sitting here [515] an admirer of the spirited steeds; [516] still I pray that he who is your favourite may win. I have come here to chat with you, and to be seated by you, [517] that the passion which yea cause may not be unknown to you. You are looking at the race, I _am looking_ at you; let us each look at what pleases us, and so let us each feast our eyes. O, happy the driver [518] of the steeds, whoever he is, that is your favourite; it is then his lot to be the object of your care; might such be my lot; with ardent zeal to be borne along would I press over the steeds as they start from the sacred barrier. [519] And now I would give rein; [520] now with my whip would I lash their backs; now with my inside wheel would I graze the turning-place. [521] If you should be seen by me in my course, then I should stop; and the reins, let go, would fall from my hands. Ah! how nearly was Pelops [522] falling by the lance of him of Pisa, while, Hippodamia, he was gazing on thy face! Still did he prove the conqueror through the favour of his mistress; [523] let us each prove victor through the favour of his charmer. Why do you shrink away in vain? [524] The partition forces us to sit close; the Circus has this advantage [525] in the arrangement of its space. But do you [526] on the right hand, whoever you are, be accommodating to the fair; she is being hurt by the pressure of your side. And you as well, [527] who are looking on behind us; draw in your legs, if you have _any_ decency, and don't press her back with your hard knees.

But do you [526] on the right hand, whoever you are, be accommodating to the fair; she is being hurt by the pressure of your side. And you as well, [527] who are looking on behind us; draw in your legs, if you have _any_ decency, and don't press her back with your hard knees. But your mantle, hanging too low, is dragging on the ground; gather it up; or see, I am taking it up [528] in my hands. A disobliging garment you are, who are thus concealing ancles so pretty; and the more you gaze upon them, the more disobliging garment you are. Such were the ancles of the fleet Atalanta, [529] which Milanion longed to touch with his hands. Such are painted the ancles of the swift Diana, when, herself _still_ bolder, she pursues the bold beasts of prey. On not seeing them, I am on fire; what would be the consequence if they _were seen?_ You are heaping flames upon flames, water upon the sea. From them I suspect that the rest may prove charming, which is so well hidden, concealed beneath the thin dress. But, meanwhile, should you like to receive the gentle breeze which the fan may cause, [530] when waved by my hand? Or is the heat I feel, rather that of my own passion, and not of the weather, and is the love of the fair burning my inflamed breast? While I am talking, your white clothes are sprinkled with the black dust; nasty dust, away from a body like the snow. But now the procession [531] is approaching; give good omens both in words and feelings. The time is come to applaud; the procession approaches, glistening with gold. First in place is Victory borne [532] with expanded wings; [533] come hither, Goddess, and grant that this passion of mine may prove victorious. \"Salute Neptune, [534] you who put too much confidence in the waves; I have nought to do with the sea; my own dry land engages me. Soldier, salute thy own Mars; arms I detest [535] Peace delights me, and Love found in the midst of Peace. Let Phoebus be propitious to the augurs, Phoebe to the huntsmen; turn, Minerva, towards thyself the hands of the artisan. [536] Ye husbandmen, arise in honour of Ceres and the youthful Bacchus; let the boxers [537] render Pollux, the horseman Castor propitious. Thee, genial Venus, and _the Loves_, the boys so potent with the bow, do I salute; be propitious, Goddess, to my aspirations. Inspire, too, kindly feelings in my new mistress; let her permit herself to be loved.\" She has assented; and with her nod she has given a favourable sign. What the Goddess has promised, I entreat yourself to promise. With the leave of Venus I will say it, you shall be the greater Goddess. By these many witnesses do I swear to you, and by this array of the Gods, that for all time you have been sighed for by me. But your legs have no support; you can, if perchance you like, rest the extremities of your feet in the lattice work. [538] Now the Prætor, [539] the Circus emptied, has sent from the even barriers [540] the chariots with their four steeds, the greatest sight of all. I see who is your favourite; whoever you wish well to, he will prove the conqueror. The very horses appear to understand what it is you wish for. Oh shocking! around the turning-place he goes with a circuit _far too_ wide. [541] What art thou about? The next is overtaking thee with his wheel in contact. What, wretched man, art thou about? Thou art wasting the good wishes of the fair; pull in the reins, I entreat, to the left, [542] with a strong hand. We have been resting ourselves in a blockhead; but still, Romans, call him back again, [543] and by waving the garments, [544] give the signal on every side. See! they are calling him back; but that the waving of the garments may not disarrange your hair, [545] you may hide yourself quite down in my bosom. And now, the barrier [546] unbarred once more, the side posts are open wide; with the horses at full speed the variegated throng [547] bursts forth. This time, at all events, [548] do prove victorious, and bound over the wide expanse; let my wishes, let those of my mistress, meet with success. The wishes of my mistress are fulfilled; my wishes still exist. He bears away the palm; [549] the palm is yet to be sought by me. She smiles, and she gives me a promise of something with her expressive eye. That is enough for this spot; grant the rest in another place. ELEGY III. _He complains of his mistress, whom he has found to be forsworn._ |Go to, believe that the Gods exist; she who had sworn has broken her faith, and still her beauty remains [550] just as it was before.

Not yet forsworn, flowing locks had she; after she has deceived the Gods, she has them just as long. Before, she was pale, having her fair complexion suffused with the blush of the rose; the blush is still beauteous on her complexion of snow. Her foot was small; still most diminutive is the size of that foot. Tall was she, and graceful; tall and graceful does she still remain. Expressive eyes had she, which shone like stars; many a time through them has the treacherous fair proved false to me. [551] Even the Gods, forsooth, for ever permit the fair to be forsworn, and beauty has its divine sway. [552] I remember that of late she swore both by her own eyes and by mine, and mine felt pain. [553] Tell me, ye Gods, if with impunity she has proved false to you, why have I suffered, punishment for the deserts of another? But the virgin daughter of Cepheus is no reproach, _forsooth_, to you, [554] who was commanded to die for her mother, so inopportunely beauteous. 'Tis not enough that I had you for witnesses to no purpose; unpunished, she laughs at even the Gods together with myself; that by my punishment she may atone for her perjuries, am I, the deceived, to be the victim of the deceiver? Either a Divinity is a name without reality, and he is revered in vain, and influences people with a silly credulity; or else, _if there is any_ God, he is fond of the charming fair, and gives them alone too much licence to be able to do any thing. Against us Mavors is girded with the fatal sword; against us the lance is directed by the invincible hand of Pallas; against us the flexible bow of Apollo is bent; against us the lofty right hand of Jove wields the lightnings. The offended Gods of heaven fear to hurt the fair; and they spontaneously dread those who dread them not. And who, then, would take care to place the frankincense in his devotion upon the altars? At least, there ought to be more spirit in men. Jupiter, with his fires, hurls at the groves [555] and the towers, and yet he forbids his weapons, thus darted, to strike the perjured female. Many a one has deserved to be struck. The unfortunate Semele [556] perished by the flames; that punishment was found for her by her own compliant disposition. But if she had betaken herself off, on the approach of her lover, his father would not have had for Bacchus the duties of a mother to perform. Why do I complain, and why blame all the heavens? The Gods have eyes as well as we; the Gods have hearts as well. Were I a Divinity myself, I would allow a woman with impunity to swear falsely by my Godhead. I myself would swear that the fair ever swear the truth; and I would not be pronounced one of the morose Divinities. Still, do you, fair one, use their favour with more moderation, or, at least, do have some regard [557] for my eyes. ELEGY IV. _He tells a jealous husband, who watches his wife, that the greater his precautions, the greater are the temptations to sin._ |Cruel husband, by setting a guard over the charming fair, thou dost avail nothing; by her own feelings must each be kept. If, all apprehensions removed, any woman is chaste, she, in fact, is chaste; she who sins not, because she cannot, _still_ sins. [558] However well you may have guarded the person, the mind is still unchaste; and, unless it chooses, it cannot be constrained. You cannot confine the mind, should you lock up every thing; when all is closed, the unchaste one will be within. The one who can sin, errs less frequently; the very opportunity makes the impulse to wantonness to be the less powerful. Be persuaded by me, and leave off instigating to criminality by constraint; by indulgence thou mayst restrain it much more effectually. I have sometimes seen the horse, struggling against his reins, rush on like lightning with his resisting mouth. Soon as ever he felt that rein was given, he stopped, and the loosened bridle lay upon his flowing mane. We are ever striving for what is forbidden, and are desiring what is denied us; even so does the sick man hanker after the water that is forbidden him. Argus used to carry a hundred eyes in his forehead, a hundred in his neck; [559] and these Love alone many a time evaded. Danaë, who, a maid, had been placed in the chamber which was to last for ever with its stone and its iron, [560] became a mother. Penelope, although she was without a keeper, amid so many youthful suitors, remained undefiled. Whatever is hoarded up, we long for it the more, and the very pains invite the thief; few care for what another giants. Not through her beauty is she captivating, but through the fondness of her husband; people suppose it to be something unusual which has so captivated thee. Suppose she is not chaste whom her husband is guarding, but faithless; she is beloved; but this apprehension itself causes her value, rather than her beauty. Be indignant if thou dost please; forbidden pleasures", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-03db9ea051409884799c6fabae5a4d1b", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "hoarded up, we long for it the more, and the very pains invite the thief; few care for what another giants.

Be indignant if thou dost please; forbidden pleasures delight me: if any woman can only say, \"I am afraid, that woman alone pleases me. Nor yet is it legal [561] to confine a free-born woman; let these fears harass the bodies of those from foreign parts. That the keeper, forsooth, may be able to say, 'I caused it she must be chaste for the credit of thy slave. He is too much of a churl whom a faithless wife injures, and is not sufficiently acquainted with the ways of the City; in which Romulus, the son of Ilia, and Remus, the son of Ilia, both begotten by Mars, were not born without a crime being committed. Why didst thou choose a beauty for thyself, if she was not pleasing unless chaste? Those two qualities [562] cannot by any means be united.'\" If thou art wise, show indulgence to thy spouse, and lay aside thy morose looks; and assert not the rights of a severe husband. Show courtesy, too, to the friends thy wife shall find thee, and many a one will she find. 'Tis thus that great credit accrues at a very small outlay of labour. Thus wilt thou be able always to take part in the festivities of the young men, and to see many a thing at home, [563] which you have not presented to her. ELEGY V. _A vision, and its explanation._ |Twas night, and sleep weighed down my wearied eyes. Such a vision as this terrified my mind. Beneath a sunny hill, a grove was standing, thick set with holm oaks; and in its branches lurked full many a bird. A level spot there was beneath, most verdant with the grassy mead, moistened with the drops of the gently trickling stream. Beneath the foliage of the trees, I was seeking shelter from the heat; still, under the foliage of the trees it was hot. Lo! seeking for the grass mingled with the variegated flowers, a white cow was standing before my eyes; more white than the snows at the moment when they have just fallen, which, time has not yet turned into flowing water. More white than the milk which is white with its bubbling foam, [564] and at that moment leaves the ewe when milked. [565] A bull there was, her companion, he, in his happiness, eas her mate; and with his own one he pressed the tender grass. While he was lying, and slowly ruminating upon the grass chewed once again; and once again was feeding on the food eaten by him before; he seemed, as sleep took away his strength, to lay his horned head upon the ground that supported it. Hither came a crow, gliding through the air on light wings; and chattering, took her seat upon the green sward; and thrice with her annoying beak did she peck at the breast of the snow-white cow; and with her bill she took away the white hair. Having remained awhile, she left the spot and the bull; but black envy was in the breast of the cow. And when she saw the bulls afar browsing upon the pastures (bulls were browsing afar upon the verdant pastures), thither did she betake herself, and she mingled among those herds, and sought out a spot of more fertile grass. \"Come, tell me, whoever thou art, thou interpreter of the dreams of the night, what (if it has any truth) this vision means.\" Thus said I: thus spoke the interpreter of the dreams of the night, as he weighed in his mind each particular that was seen; \"The heat which thou didst wish to avoid beneath the rustling leaves, but didst but poorly avoid, was that of Love. The cow is thy mistress; that complexion is suited to the fair. Thou wast the male, and the bull with the fitting mate. Inasmuch as the crow pecked at her breast with her sharp beak; an old hag of a procuress [566] will tempt the affections of thy mistress. In that, after hesitating long, his heifer left the bull, thou wilt be left to be chilled in a deserted couch. Envy and the black spots below the front of her breast, show that she is not free from the reproach of inconstancy.\" Thus spoke the interpreter; the blood retreated from my chilled face; and profound night stood before my eyes. ELEGY VI. _He addresses a river which has obstructed his passage while he is going to his mistress._ |River that hast [567] thy slimy banks planted with reeds, to my mistress I am hastening; stay thy waters for a moment. No bridges hast thou, nor yet a hollow boat [568] to carry one over without the stroke of the oar, by means of the rope thrown across.

Thou wast a small stream, I recollect; and I did not hesitate to pass across thee; and the surface of thy waves then hardly reached to my ancles. Now, from the opposite mountain [569] thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in thy turbid stream thou dost pour thy muddied waters. What avails it me thus to have hastened? What to have given so little time to rest? What to have made the night all one with the day? 569 If still I must be standing here; if, by no contrivance, thy opposite banks are granted to be trodden by my foot. Now do I long for the wings which the hero, the son of Danaë, [570] possessed, when he bore away the head, thickset with the dreadful serpents; now do I wish for the chariot, [571] from which the seed of Ceres first came, thrown upon the uncultivated ground. Of the wondrous fictions of the ancient poets do I speak; no time has produced, nor does produce, nor will produce these wonders. Rather, do thou, stream that dost overflow thy wide banks, flow within thy limits, then for ever mayst thou run on. Torrent, thou wilt not, believe me, be able to endure the reproaches, if perchance I should be mentioned as detained by thee in my love. Rivers ought rather to aid youths in their loves; rivers themselves have experienced what love is. Inachus [572] is said to have flowed pale with love for Melie, [573] the Bithynian Nymph, and to have warmed throughout his cold fords. Not yet was Troy besieged for twice five years, when, Xanthus, Neæra attracted thy eyes. Besides; did not enduring love for the Arcadian maid force Alpheus [574] to run through various lands? They say, too, that thou, Peneus, didst conceal, in the lands of the Phthiotians, Creüsa, [575] already betrothed to Xanthus. Why should I mention Asopus, whom Thebe, beloved by Mars, [576] received, Thebe, destined to be the parent of five daughters? Should I ask of Achelous, \"Where now are thy horns?\" thou wouldst complain that they were broken away by the wrathful hand of Hercules. [577] Not of such value was Calydon, [578] nor of such value was the whole of Ætolia; still, of such value was Deianira alone. The enriching Nile, that flows through his seven mouths, who so well conceals the native spot [579] of waters so vast, is said not to have been able to overpower by his stream the flame that was kindled by Evadne, the daughter of Asopus. [580] Enipeus, dried up, [581] that he might be enabled to embrace the daughter of Salmoneus, bade his waters to depart; his waters, so ordered, did depart. Nor do I pass thee by, who as thou dost roll amid the hollow rocks, foaming, dost water the fields of Argive Tibur [582] whom Ilia [583] captivated, although she was unsightly in her garb, bearing the marks of her nails on her locks, the marks of her nails on her cheeks. Bewailing both the crimes of her uncle, and the fault of Mars, she was wandering along the solitary spots with naked feet. Her the impetuous stream beheld from his rapid waves, and raised his hoarse mouth from the midst of his fords, and thus he said: \"Why, in sorrow, art thou pacing my banks, Ilia, the descendant of Laomedon [584] of Ida? Whither have gone thy vestments? Why wandering thus alone? And why does no white fillet [585] bind thy hair tied up? Why weepest thou, and why spoil thy eyes wet with tears? And why beat thy open breast with frenzied hand? That man has both flints and ore of iron in his breast, who, unconcerned, beholds the tears on thy delicate face. Ilia, lay aside thy fears; my palace shall be opened unto thee; the streams, too, shall obey thee; Ilia, lay aside thy fears. Among a hundred Nymphs or more, thou shalt hold the sway; for a hundred or more does my stream contain. Only, descendant of Troy, despise me not, I pray; gifts more abundant than my promises shalt thou receive.\" _Thus_ he said; she casting on the ground her modest eyes, as she wept, besprinkled her warm breast with her tears. Thrice did she attempt to fly; thrice did she stop short at the deep waves, as fear deprived her of the power of running. Still, at last, as with hostile fingers she tore her hair, with quivering lips she uttered these bitter words; \"Oh! would that my bones had been gathered up, and hidden in the tomb of my fathers, while yet they could be gathered, belonging to me a virgin! Why now, am I courted [586] for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be driven from the altars of Ilium? Why do I hesitate? See! by the fingers of the multitude am I pointed at as unchaste. Let this disgrace be ended, which marks my features.\" Thus far _did she speak_, and before her swollen eyes she extended her robe; and so, in her despair, did she throw herself [587] into the rapid waters", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d13dcdd4ee9b4b632310a1a196718c4b", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ", am I courted [586] for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be driven from the altars of Ilium?

Let this disgrace be ended, which marks my features.\" Thus far _did she speak_, and before her swollen eyes she extended her robe; and so, in her despair, did she throw herself [587] into the rapid waters. The flowing stream is said to have placed his hands beneath her breast, and to have conferred on her the privilege of his nuptial couch. 'Tis worthy of belief, too, that thou hast been inflamed _with love_ for some maiden; but the groves and woods conceal thy failings. While I have been talking, it has become more swollen with its extending waves, and the deep channel contains not the rushing waters. What, furious torrent, hast thou against me? Why thus delay our mutual transports? Why, churlish river, interrupt the journey once commenced? What if thou didst flow according to some fixed rule, [588] a river of some note? What if thy fame was mighty throughout the earth? But no name hast thou collected from the exhausted rivulets; thou hast no springs, no certain abode hast thou. In place of spring, thou hast rain and melted snow; resources which the sluggish winter supplies to thee. Either in muddy guise, in winter time, thou dost speed onward in thy course; or filled with dust, thou dost pass over the parched ground. What thirsty traveller has been able to drink of thee then? Who has said, with grateful lips, \"Mayst thou flow on for ever?\" _Onward_ thou dost run, injurious to the flocks, [589] still more injurious to the fields. Perhaps these _mischiefs may move_ others; my own evils move me. And, oh shocking! did I in my madness relate to this stream the loves of the rivers? I am ashamed unworthily to have pronounced names so great. Gazing on I know not what, could I speak of the rivers [590] Acheloüs and Inachus, and could I, Nile, talk of thy name? But for thy deserts, torrent far from clear, I wish that for thee there may be scorching heat, and winter always dry.

ELEGY VIII. _He laments that he is not received by his mistress, and complains that she gives the preference to a wealthy rival._ |And does any one still venerate the liberal arts, or suppose that soft verses have any merit? Genius once was more precious than gold; but now, to be possessed of nought is the height of ignorance. After my poems [591] have proved very pleasing to my mistress, it is not allowed me to go where it has been allowed my books. When she has much bepraised me, her door is shut on him who is praised; talented _though I be_, I disgracefully wander up and down. Behold! a Knight gorged with blood, lately enriched, his wealth acquired [592] through his wounds, [593] is preferred before myself. And can you, my life, enfold him in your charming arms? Can you, my life, rush into his embrace? If you know it not, that head used to wear a helmet; that side which is so at your service, was girded with a sword. That left hand, which thus late [594] the golden ring so badly suits, used to bear the shield; touch his right, it has been stained with blood. And can you touch that right hand, by which some person has met his death? Alas! where is that tenderness of heart of yours? Look at his scars, the traces of his former fights; whatever he possesses, by that body was it acquired. [595] Perhaps, too, he will tell how often he has stabbed a man; covetous one, will you touch the hand that confesses this? I, unstained, the priest of the Muses and of Phoebus, am he who is singing his bootless song before your obdurate doors. Learn, you who are wise, not what we idlers know, but how to follow the anxious troops, and the ruthless camp; instead of good verses hold sway over [596] the first rank; through this, Homer, hadst thou wished it, she might have proved kind to thee. Jupiter, well aware that nothing is more potent than gold, was himself the reward of the ravished damsel. [597] So long as the bribe was wanting, the father was obdurate, she herself prudish, the door-posts bound with brass, the tower made of iron; but after the knowing seducer resorted to presents, [598] she herself opened her lap; and, requested to surrender, she did surrender. But when the aged Saturn held the realms of the heavens, the ground kept all money deep in its recesses. To the shades below had he removed brass and silver, and, together with gold, the weight of iron; and", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-79465f6fd525b49edfa758554ce7718c", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "obdurate, she herself prudish, the door-posts bound with brass, the tower made of iron; but after the knowing seducer resorted to presents, [598] she herself opened her lap; and, requested to surrender, she did surrender. But when the aged Saturn held the realms of the heavens, the ground kept all money deep in its recesses. To the shades below had he removed brass and silver, and, together with gold, the weight of iron; and no ingots were there _in those times_. But she used to give what was better, corn without the crooked plough-share, apples too, and honey found in the hollow oak. And no one used with sturdy plough to cleave the soil; with no boundaries [599] did the surveyor mark out the ground. The oars dipped down did not skim the upturned waves; then was the shore [601] the limit of the paths of men. Human nature, against thyself hast thou been so clever; and for thy own destruction too ingenious. To what purpose surround cities with turreted fortifications? [602] To what purpose turn hostile hands to arms? What hast thou to do with the sea? With the earth thou mightst have been content. Why not seek the heavens [603] as well, for a third realm? To the heavens, too, dost thou aspire, so far as thou mayst. Quirinus, Liber, and Alcides, and Caesar but recently, [604] have their temples. Instead of corn, we dig the solid gold from the earth; the soldier possesses riches acquired by blood. To the poor is the Senate-house [605] shut; wealth alone confers honours; [606] hence, the judge so grave; hence the knight so proud. Let them possess it all; let the field of Mars [607] and the Forum [608] obey them; let these administer peace and cruel warfare. Only, in their greediness, let them not tear away my mistress; and 'tis enough, so they but allow something to belong to the poor. But now-a-days, he that is able to give away plenty, rules it _over a woman_ like a slave, even should she equal the prudish Sabine dames. The keeper is in my way; with regard to me, [609] she dreads her husband. If I were to make presents, both of them would entirely disappear from the house. Oh! if any God is the avenger of the neglected lover, may he change riches, so ill-gotten, into dust. ELEGY IX. _He laments the death of the Poet Tibullus._ |If his mother has lamented Memnon, his mother Achilles, and if sad deaths influence the great Goddesses; plaintive Elegy, unbind thy sorrowing tresses; alas! too nearly will thy name be derived from fact! The Poet of thy own inspiration, [610] Tibullus, thy glory, is burning, a lifeless body, on the erected pile. [611] Lo! the son of Venus bears both his quiver inverted, and his bow broken, and his torch without a flame; behold how wretched with drooping wings he goes: and how he beats his naked breast with cruel hand. His locks dishevelled about his neck receive his tears, and his mouth resounds with sobs that convulse his body. 'Twas thus, beauteous Iulus, they say that thou didst go forth from thy abode, at the funeral of his brother Æneas. Not less was Venus afflicted when Tibullus died, than when the cruel boar [612] tore the groin of the youth. And yet we Poets are called 'hallowed,' and the care of the Deities; there are some, too, who believe that we possess inspiration. [613] Inexorable Death, forsooth, profanes all that is hallowed; upon all she lays her [614] dusky hands. What availed his father, what, his mother, for Ismarian Orpheus [615] What, with his songs to have lulled the astounded wild beasts? The same father is said, in the lofty woods, to have sung 'Linus! Alas! Linus! Alas! [616] to his reluctant lyre. Add the son of Mæon, [617] too, by whom, as though an everlasting stream, the mouths of the poets are refreshed by the waters of Piëria: him, too, has his last day overwhelmed in black Avernus; his verse alone escapes the all-consuming pile. The fame of the Trojan toils, the work of the Poets is lasting, and the slow web woven [618] again through the stratagem of the night. So shall Nemesis, so Delia, [619] have a lasting name; the one, his recent choice, the other his first love. What does sacrifice avail thee? [620] Of what use are now the 'sistra' of Egypt? What, lying apart [621] in a forsaken bed? When the cruel Destinies snatch away the good, (pardon the confession) I am tempted to think that there are no Deities. Live piously; pious _though you be_, you shall die; attend the sacred worship; _still_ ruthless Death shall drag the worshipper from the temples to the yawning tomb.

[622] Put your trust in the excellence of your verse; see! Tibullus lies prostrate; of so much, there hardly remains _enough_ for a little urn to receive. And, hallowed Poet, have the flames of the pile consumed thee, and have they not been afraid to feed upon that heart of thine? They could have burned the golden temples of the holy Gods, that have dared a crime so great. She turned away her face, who holds the towers of Eryx; [623] there are some, too, who affirm that she did not withhold her tears. But still, this is better than if the Phæacian land [624] had buried him a stranger, in an ignoble spot. Here, [625] at least, a mother pressed his tearful eyes [626] as he fled, and presented the last gifts [627] to his ashes; here a sister came to share the grief with her wretched mother, tearing her unadorned locks. And with thy relatives, both Nemesis and thy first love [628] joined their kisses; and they left not the pile in solitude. Delia, as she departed, said, \"More fortunately was I beloved by thee; so long as I was thy flame, thou didst live.\" To her said Nemesis: \"What dost thou say? Are my sufferings a pain to thee? When dying, he grasped me with his failing hand.\" [629] If, however, aught of us remains, but name and spirit, Tibullus will exist in the Elysian vales. Go to meet him, learned Catullus, [630] with thy Calvus, having thy youthful temples bound with ivy. Thou too, Gallus, (if the accusation of the injury of thy friend is false) prodigal of thy blood [631] and of thy life. Of these, thy shade is the companion; if only there is any shade of the body, polished Tibullus; thou hast swelled the blessed throng. Rest, bones, I pray, in quiet, in the untouched urn; and may the earth prove not heavy for thy ashes. ELEGY X. _He complains to Ceres that during her rites he is separated from his mistress._ |The yearly season of the rites of Ceres [632] is come: my mistress lies apart on a solitary couch. Yellow Ceres, having thy floating locks crowned with ears of corn, why dost thou interfere with my pleasures by thy rites? Thee, Goddess, nations speak of as bounteous everywhere: and no one is less unfavorable to the blessings of mankind. In former times the uncouth peasants did not parch the corn; and the threshing floor was a name unknown on earth. But the oaks, the early oracles, [633] used to bear acorns; these, and the grass of the shooting sod, were the food of men. Ceres was the first to teach the seed to swell in the fields, and with the sickle did she cut her coloured locks; she first forced the bulls to place their necks beneath the yoke; and she with crooked tooth turned up the fallow ground. Can any one believe that she takes delight in the tears of lovers, and is duly propitiated with misery and single-blessedness? Nor yet (although she loves the fruitful fields) is she a coy one; nor lias she a breast devoid of love. The Cretans shall be my witnesses; and the Cretans do not feign everything; the Cretans, a nation proud of having nurtured Jove. [634] There, he who rules the starry citadel of the world, a little child, drank milk with tender lips. There is full confidence in the witness; by its foster-child the witness is recommended I think that Ceres will confess her frailties, so well known. The Goddess had beheld Iasius [635] at the foot of Cretan Ida, as he pierced the backs of the wild beasts with unerring hand. She beheld, and when her tender marrow caught the flame; on the one side Shame, on the other Love, inflamed her. Shame was conquered by Love; you might see the furrows lying dry, and the crops coming up with a very small proportion of their wheat. [636] When the mattocks stoutly wielded had turned up the land, and the crooked plough had broken the hard earth, and the seed had fallen equally scattered over the wide fields; the hopes of the deceived husbandman were vain. The Goddess, the guardian of corn, was lingering in the lofty woods; the wreaths of com had fallen from her flowing locks. Crete alone was fertile in its fruitful year; all places, whither the Goddess had betaken herself, were one continued harvest. Ida, the locality itself for groves, grew white with corn, and the wild boar cropped the ears in the woods. The law-giving Minos [637] wished for himself many like years; he wished that the love of Ceres might prove lasting. Whereas, yellow-haired Goddess, single-blessedness would have been sad to thee; this am I now compelled by thy rites to endure. Why should I be sad, when thy daughter has been found again by thee, and rules over realms, only less than Juno in rank? This festive day calls for both Venus, and songs, and wine. These gifts is it fitting to bear to the ruling Gods.

These gifts is it fitting to bear to the ruling Gods. ELEGY XI. _He tells his mistress that he cannot help loving her._ |Much and long time have I suffered; by your faults is my patience overcome. Depart from my wearied breast, disgraceful Love. In truth I have now liberated myself, and I have burst my chains; and I am ashamed to have borne what it shamed me not to endure. I have conquered; and Love subdued I have trodden under foot; late have the horns [638] come upon my head. Have patience, and endure, [639] this pain will one day avail thee; often has the bitter potion given refreshment to the sick. And could I then endure, repulsed so oft from thy doors, to lay a free-born body upon the hard ground? [640] And did I then, like a slave, keep watch before thy street door, for some stranger I know not whom, that you were holding in your embrace? And did I behold it, when the wearied paramour came out of your door, carrying off his jaded and exhausted sides? Still, this is more endurable than the fact that I was beheld by him; [641] may that disgrace be the lot of my foes. When have I not kept close fastened to your side as you walked, [642] myself your keeper, myself your husband, myself your companion? And, celebrated by me forsooth, did you please the public: my passion was the cause of passion in many. Why mention the base perjuries of your perfidious tongue? and why the Gods forsworn [643] for my destruction? Why the silent nods of young men at banquets, [644] and words concealed in signs arranged _beforehand?_ She was reported to me to be ill; headlong and distracted I ran; I arrived; and, to my rival she was not ill. [645] Bearing these things, and others on which I am silent, I have oft endured them; find another in my stead, who could put up with these things. Now my ship, crowned with the votive chaplet, listens in safety to the swelling waves of the ocean. Cease to lavish your blandishments and the words which once availed; I am not a fool, as once I was. Love on this side, Hatred on that, are struggling, and are dragging my tender heart in opposite directions; but Love, I think, still gets the better. I will hate, [646] if I can; if not, reluctantly will I love; the bull loves not his yoke; still, that which he hates he bears. I fly from treachery; your beauty, as I fly, brings me back; I abhor the failings of your morals; your person I love. Thus, I can neither live without you, nor yet with you; and I appear to be unacquainted with my own wishes. I wish that either you were less handsome, or less unprincipled. So beauteous a form does not suit morals so bad. Your actions excite hatred; your beauty demands love. Ah wretched me! she is more potent than her frailties. O pardon me, by the common rites of our bed, by all the Gods who so often allow themselves to be deceived by you, and by your beauty, equal to a great Divinity with me, and by your eyes, which have captivated my own; whatever you shall be, ever shall you be mine; only do you make choice whether you will wish me to wish as well to love you, or whether I am to love you by compulsion. I would rather spread my sails and use propitious gales; since, though I should refuse, I shall still be forced to love. ELEGY XII. _He complains that he has rendered his mistress so celebrated by his verses, as to have thereby raised for himself many rivals._ |What day was that, on which, ye birds of no white hue, you sent forth your ominous notes, ever sad to me in my loves? Or what star must I consider to be the enemy of my destiny? Or what Deities am I to complain of, as waging war against me? She, who but lately [647] was called my own, whom I commenced alone to love, I fear that with many she must be shared by me. Am I mistaken? Or has she gained fame by my poems? 'Tis so; by my genius has she been made public. And justly; for why have I made proclamation [648] of her charms? Through my fault has the fair been put up for sale. She pleases, and I the procurer; by my guidance is the lover introduced; by my hands has her door been opened. Whether verses are of any use, is matter of doubt; at all events, they have injured me; they have been envious of my happiness. While Thebes, [649] while Troy, while the exploits of Caesar existed; Corinna alone warmed my genius.

Would that I had meddled with verses against the will of the Muses; and that Phoebus had deserted the work commenced! And yet, it is not the custom to listen to Poets as witnesses; [650] I would have preferred all weight to be wanting to my words. Through us, Scylla, who robbed her father of his white hair, bears the raging dogs [651] beneath her thigh and loins. We have given wings to the feet, serpents to the hair; the victorious descendant of Abas [652] is borne upon the winged steed. We, too, have extended Tityus [653] over the vast space, and have formed the three mouths for the dog bristling -with snakes. We have described Enceladus, [654] hurling with his thousand arms; and the heroes captivated by the voice of the two-shaped damsels. [655] In the Ithacan bags [656] have we enclosed the winds of Æolus; the treacherous Tantalus thirsts in the middle of the stream. Of Niobe we have made the rock, of the damsel, the she-bear; the Cecropian [657] bird sings of Odrysian Itys. Jupiter transforms himself, either into a bird, or into gold [658] or, as a bull, with the virgin placed upon him, he cleaves the waves. Why mention Proteus, and the Theban seed, [659] the teeth? Why that there were bulls, which vomited flames from their mouths? Why, charioteer, that thy sisters distil amber tears? [660] Why that they are now Goddesses of the sea, who once were ships? [661] Why that the light of day fled from the hellish banquet [662] of Atreus? And why that the hard stones followed the lyre [663] as it was struck? The fertile license of the Poets ranges over an immense space; and it ties not its words to the accuracy of history. So, too, ought my mistress to have been deemed to be falsely praised; now is your credulity a mischief to me. ELEGY XIII. _He describes the Festival of Juno, as celebrated at Falisci, the native place of his wife._ As my wife was born at Falisci, so fruitful in apples, we repaired to the walls that were conquered, Camillus, by thee. [664] The priestesses were preparing the chaste festival of Juno, with distinguished games, and the heifer of the country. 'Twas a great remuneration for my stay, to be acquainted with the ceremony; although a path, difficult from the ascent, leads the way thither. There stands a grove, ancient, and shaded with numberless trees; look at it, you must confess that a Divinity exists in the spot. An altar receives the prayers, and the votive incense of the pious; an altar made without skill, by ancient hands. When, from this spot, the pipe has given the signal with its usual note, the yearly procession moves along the covered paths. [665] Snow-white heifers [666] are led, as the crowd applauds, which the Faliscan grass has fed on its own plains; calves, too, not yet threatening with the forehead to inspire fear; and the pig, a smaller victim, from its lowly sty; the leader too, of the flock, with his horns bending back over his hardy temples; the goat alone is odious to the Goddess queen. By her betrayal, discovered in the lofty woods, [667] she is said to have desisted from the flight she had commenced. Even now, by the boys, is she aimed at as a mark; [668] and she is given, as a prize, to the author of her wound. Where the Goddess is to come, the youths and bashful girls sweep the roads before her, with garments [669] as they lie. Their virgin hair is adorned with gold and gems; and the proud mantle conceals their feet, bedecked with gold. After the Grecian manner [670] of their ancestors, clad in white garments, they bear the sacred vessels entrusted to them on their heads, placed beneath. The people hold religious silence, [671] at the moment when the resplendent procession comes up; and she herself follows after her priestesses. Argive is the appearance of the procession; Agamemnon slain, Halesus [672] fled from both his crime and his father's wealth. And now, an exile, having wandered over both land and sea, he erected lofty walls with prospering hand. He taught his own Falisci the rites of Juno. May they be ever propitious to myself, may they be ever so to her own people. ELEGY XIV. _He entreats his mistress, if she will not be constant, at least, to conceal her intrigues from him._ |Beauteous since you are, I do not forbid your being frail; but let it not be a matter of course, that wretched I should know it. Nor does any severity of mine command you to be quite correct; but it only entreats you to try to conceal the truth. She is not culpable, whoever can deny that she has been culpable; and 'tis only the confession of error that makes a woman disgraced. What madness is it to confess in light of day what lies concealed in night? And what you do in secret, to say openly that it is done?

What madness is it to confess in light of day what lies concealed in night? And what you do in secret, to say openly that it is done? The strumpet about to entertain some obscure Roman, first keeps out the public by fastening up the bar. And will you make known your frailties to malicious report? And will you make proof of your own criminality? May your mind be more sound, or, at least, may you imitate the chaste; and although you are not, let me suppose that you are chaste. What you do, still do the same; only deny that you do so; and be not ashamed in public to speak the language of chastity. There is the occasion which demands wantonness; sate it with every delight; far thence be all modesty. Soon as you take your departure thence; away at once with all lasciviousness, and leave your frailties in your chamber= ```Illic nec tunicam tibi sit posuisse rubori, ````Nec femori impositum sustinuisse femur: ```Illic purpureis condatur lingua labellis: ````Inque modos Venerem mille figuret amor; ```Illic nec voces, nec verba juvantia cessent; ````Spondaque lascivâ mobilitate tremat.= With your garments put on looks that dread accusation; and let modesty disavow improper pursuits. Deceive the public, deceive me, too; in my ignorance, let me be mistaken, and allow me to enjoy my silly credulity. Why do I so often espy letters sent and received? Why one side and the other [673] tumbled, of your couch? Why do I see your hair disarranged more than happens in sleep, and your neck bearing the marks of teeth? The fading itself alone you do not bring before my eyes; if you hesitate consulting your own reputation, still, spare me. My senses fail me, and I am expiring, oft as you confess your failings; and the drops flow, chilled throughout my limbs. Then do I love you; then, in vain, do I hate what I am forced to love; 673 then I could wish myself to be dead, but together with you. No enquiries, for my part, will I make, nor will I try to know what you shall attempt to conceal; and to me it shall be the same as a false charge. If, however, you shall be found detected in the midst of your guilt, and if criminality shall be beheld by my eyes; what has been plainly seen, do you deny to have been plainly seen; my own eyes shall give way to your assertions.'Tis an easy conquest for you to vanquish me, who desire to be vanquished. Let your tongue only be mindful to say--\"I did not do it!\" since it is your lot to conquer with two words; although not by the merit of your cause, still conquer through your judge. ELEGY X. _He tells Venus that he now ceases to write Elegies._ |Seek a new Poet, mother of the tender Loves; here the extreme turning-place is grazed [674] by my Elegies, which I, a foster-child of the Pelignian fields, have composed; nor have my sportive lays disgraced me. _Me, I say, who_, if that is aught, am the heir to my rank, [675] even through a long line of ancestors, and not lately made a Knight in the hurly-burly of warfare. Mantua delights in Virgil, Verona in Catullus; I shall be called the glory of the Pelignian race; which its own liberties summon to glorious arms, [676] when trembling Rome dreaded [677] the allied bands. And some stranger will say, as he looks on the walls of the watery Sulmo, which occupy but a few acres of land, \"Small as you are, I will call you great, who were able to produce a Poet so great.\" Beauteous boy, and thou, Amathusian parent [678] of the beauteous boy, raise your golden standard from my fields. The horned [679] Lyæus [680] has struck me with a thyrsus more potent; with mighty steeds must a more extended plain be paced. Unwarlike Elegies, my sportive [681] Muse, farewell; a work destined to survive long after I am dead and gone.---- FOOTNOTES BOOK ONE: [Footnote 001: Were five books.--Ver. 1. From this it is clear, that the first edition which Ovid gave to the public of his 'Amores' was in five Books; but that on revising his work, he preferred (praetulit) these three books to the former five. It is supposed that he rejected many of those Elegies which were of too free a nature and were likely to embroil him with the authorities, by reason of their licentiousness.] [Footnote 002: Though it should.--Ver. 3.

Burmann has rightly observed, that 'ut jam,' in this line, has exactly the force of 'quamvis,' 'although.'] [Footnote 003: In serious numbers.--Ver. 1. By the 'graves numeri,' he means Heroic or Hexameter verses. It is supposed that he alludes to the battle of the Giants or the Titans, on which subject he had begun to write an heroic poem. In these lines Ovid seems to have had in view the commencement of the first Ode of Anacreon.] [Footnote 004: Suited to the measure.--Ver. 2. The subject being of a grave character, and, as such, suited to Heroic measure.] [Footnote 005: Abstracted one foot.--Ver. 4. He says that every second line (as is the case in Heroic verse) had as many feet as the first, namely, six : but that Cupid stole a foot from the Hexameter, and reduced it to a Pentameter, whereby the Poet was forced to recur to the Elegiac measure.] [Footnote 008: Diminish my energies.--Ver. 18. See the Note to the fourth line.] [Footnote 009: His quiver loosened.--Ver. 21. The 'pharetra,' or quiver, filled with arrows, was used by most of the nations that excelled in archery, among whom were the Scythians, Persians, Lycians, Thracians, and Cretans. It was made of leather, and was sometimes adorned with gold or painting. It had a lid, and was suspended by a belt from the right shoulder. Its usual position was on the left hip, and it was thus worn by the Scythians and Egyptians. The Cretans, however, wore it behind the back, and Diana, in her statues, is represented as so doing. This must have been the method in which Cupid is intended in the present instance to wear it, as he has to unloose the quiver before he takes out the arrow. Some Commentators, however, would have 'solutâ' to refer simply to the act of opening the quiver.] [Footnote 010: In six feet.--Ver. 27. He says that he must henceforth write in Hexameters and Pentameters, or, in other words, in the Elegiac measure.] [Footnote 011: My Muse.--Ver. 30. The Muse addressed by him would be Erato, under whose protection were those Poets whose theme was Love. He bids her wreathe her hair with myrtle, because it was sacred to Venus; while, on the other hand, laurels would be better adapted to the Heroic Muse. The myrtle is said to love the moisture and coolness of the sea-shore.] [Footnote 014: Thy step-father.--Ver. 24. He calls Mars the step-father of Cupid, in consequence of his intrigue with Venus.] [Footnote 015: Birds so yoked.--Ver. 26. These are the doves which were sacred to Venus and Cupid. By yoking them to the chariot of Mars, the Poe wishes to show the skill and power of Cupid.] [Footnote 016: Io triumphe.--Ver. 25. 'Clamare triumphum,' means 'to shout Io triumphe,' as the procession moves along. Lactantius speaks of a poem called 'the Triumph of Cupid,' in which Jupiter and the other Gods were represented as following him in the triumphal procession.] [Footnote 017: Thyself with gold.--Ver. 42. The poet Mosehus represents Cupid as having wings of gold.] [Footnote 018: The Gangetic land.--Ver. 47. He alludes to the Indian triumphs of Bacchus, which extended to the river Ganges.] [Footnote 019: Thy kinsman Cæsar--Ver. 51. Because Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Cæsar, was said to be descended from Venus, through the line of Æneas.] [Footnote 020: Shield the conquered.--Ver. 52. Although Augustus had many faults, it must be admitted that he was, like Julius, a most merciful conqueror, and was generally averse to bloodshed.] [Footnote 021: Founder of my family. --Ver. 8. See the Life of Ovid prefixed to the Fasti; and the Second Book of the Tristia.] [Footnote 022: Each of my parents.--Ver. 10. From this it appears that this Elegy was composed during the life-time of both of his parents, and while, probably, he was still dependent on his father.] [Footnote 023: No rover in affection.--Ver. 15. 'Desuitor,' literally means 'one who leaps off.' The figure is derived from those equestrians who rode upon several horses, or guided several chariots, passing from the one to the other. This sport was very frequently exhibited in the Roman Circus. Among the Romans, the 'desuitor' generally wore a 'pileus,' or cap of felt. The Numidian, Scythian, and Armenian soldiers, were said to have been skilled in the same art.] [Footnote 024: Of the bird.--Ver. 22. He alludes to Leda and Europa.] [Footnote 026: The same banquet.--Ver. 1. He says that they are about to meet at 'coena,' at the house of a common friend.] [Footnote 027: The last meal.--Ver. 2.

He alludes to Leda and Europa.] [Footnote 026: The same banquet.--Ver. 1. He says that they are about to meet at 'coena,' at the house of a common friend.] [Footnote 027: The last meal.--Ver. 2. The 'coena' of the Romans is usually translated by the word 'supper'; but as being the chief meal of the day, and being in general, (at least during the Augustan age) taken at about three o'clock, it really corresponds to our 'dinner.'] [Footnote 028: Warm the bosom of another.--Ver. 5. As each guest while reclining on the couch at the entertainment, mostly leaned on his left elbow during the meal, and as two or more persons lay on the same couch, the head of one person reached to the breast of him who lay above him, and the lower person was said to lie on the bosom of the other. Among the Romans, the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three. Sometimes, however, four occupied one couch; while, among the Greeks, only two reclined upon it. In this instance, he describes the lady as occupying the place below her husband, and consequently warming his breast with her head. For a considerable time after the fashion of reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the Roman ladies sat at meals while the other sex was recumbent. Indeed, it was generally considered more becoming for females to be seated, especially if it was a party where many persons were present. Juvenal, however, represents a bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the bosom of her husband. On the present occasion, it is not very likely that the ladies were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette. It must be remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken off.] [Footnote 029: Damsel of Atrax.--Ver. 8. He alludes to the marriage of Hippodamia to Pirithous, and the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapithæ, described in the Twelfth-. Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 031: Do come first.--Ver. 14. He hardly knows why he asks her to do so, but still she must come before her husband; perhaps, that he may have the pleasure of gazing upon her without the chance of detection; the more especially as she would not recline till her husband had arrived, and would, till then, probably be seated.] [Footnote 032: Touch my foot.--Ver. 16. This would show that she had safely received his letter.] [Footnote 033: My secret signs.--Ver. 18. See the Note in this Volume, to the 90th line of the 17th Epistle.] [Footnote 034: By my eye-brows.--Ver. 19. See the 82nd line of the 17th Epistle.] [Footnote 035: Traced in the wine.--Ver. 20. See the 88th line of the 17th Epistle.] [Footnote 036: Your blooming cheeks.--Ver. 22. Probably by way of check to his want of caution.] [Footnote 037: Twisted on your fingers.--Ver. 26. The Sabines were the first to introduce the practice of wearing rings among the Romans. The Romans generally wore one ring, at least, and mostly upon the fourth finger of the left hand. Down to the latest period of the Republic, the rings were mostly of iron, and answered the'purpose of a signet. The right of wearing a gold ring remained for several centuries the exclusive privilege of Senators, Magistrates, and Knights. The emperors were not very scrupulous on whom they conferred the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and Severus and Aurelian gave the right to all Roman soldiers. Vain persons who had the privilege, literally covered their fingers with rings, so much so, that Quintilian thinks it necessary to warn the orator not to have them above the middle joint of the fingers. The rings and the gems set in them, were often of extreme beauty and value. From Juvenal and Martial we learn that the coxcombs of the day had rings for both winter and summer wear. They were kept in 'dactyliothecæ,' or ring boxes, where they were ranged in a row.] [Footnote 038: Who are in prayer.--Ver. 27. It was the custom to hold the altar while the suppliant was praying to the Deities; he here directs her, while she is mentally uttering imprecations against her husband, to fancy that the table is the altar, and to take hold of it accordingly.] [Footnote 039: If you are discreet.--Ver. 29. Sapias' is put for 'si sapias,' 'if you are discreet,' 'if you would act sensibly.'] [Footnote 041: Ask the servant.--Ver. 30. This would be the slave, whose office it was to mix the wine and water to the taste of the guests.

That is, which she either puts upon the table, or gives back to the servant, when she has drunk.] [Footnote 043: Touched by his mouth.--Ver. 34. This would appear to refer to some choice morsel picked out of the husband's plate, which, as a mark of attention, he might present to her.] [Footnote 044: On his unsightly breast.--Ver. 36. This, from her position, if she reclined below her husband, she would be almost obliged to do.] [Footnote 045: So close at hand.--Ver. 37. A breach of these injunctions would imply either a very lax state of etiquette at the Reman parties, or, what is more probable, that the present company was not of a very select character.] [Footnote 048: Beneath the cloth.--Ver. 48. 'Vestis' means a covering, or clothing for anything, as for a couch, or for tapestry. Let us charitably suppose it here to mean the table cloth; as the passage will not admit of further examination, and has of necessity been somewhat modified in the translation.] [Footnote 049: The conscious covering.--Ver. 50. The 'pallia,' here mentioned, are clearly the coverlets of the couch which he has before mentioned in the 41st line; and from this it is evident, that during the repast the guests were covered with them.] [Footnote 050: Add wine by stealth.--Ver. 52. To make him fall asleep the sooner] [Footnote 051: 'Twas summer time.--Ver. 1. In all hot climates it is the custom to repose in the middle of the day. This the Spaniards call the 'siesta.'] [Footnote 053: A part of the window.--Ver. 3. On the 'fenestræ,' or windows of the ancients, see the Notes to the Pontic Epistles, Book iii. Ep. iii. 1. 5, and to the Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 752. He means that one leaf of the window was open, and one shut.] [Footnote 054: Corinna.--Ver. 9. In the Fourth Book of the Tristia, Elegy x. 1. GO, he says, 'Corinna, (so called by a fictitious name) the subject of song through the whole city, had imparted a stimulus to my geuius.' It has been supposed by some Commentators, that under this name he meant Julia, either the daughter or the grand-daughter of the emperor Augustus, but there seems really to be no ground for such a belief; indeed, the daughter of Augustus had passed middle age, when Ovid was still in boyhood. It is most probable that Corinna was ouly an ideal personage, existing in the imagination of the Poet; and that he intended the name to apply to his favourite mistress for the time being, as, though he occasionally denies it, still, at other times, he admits that his passion was of the roving kind. There are two females mentioned in history of the name of Coriuna. One was a Theban poetess, who excelled in Lyric composition, and was said to have vanquished Pindar himself in a Lyric contest; while the other was a native of Thespiæ, in Bceotia. 'The former, who was famous for both her personal charms and her mental endowments, is supposed to have suggested the use of the name to Ovid.] [Footnote 055: Clothed in a tunic.--Ver. 9. 'Tunica' was the name of the under-garment with both sexes among the Romans. When the wearer was out of doors, or away from home, it was fastened round the waist with a belt or girdle, but when at home and wishing to be entirely at ease, it was, as in the present instance, loose or ungirded. Both sexes usually wore two tunics. In female dress, Varro seems to call the outer tunic 'subucula,' and the 'interior tunica' by the name also of 'indusium.' The outer tunic was also called 'stola,' and, with the 'palla' completed the female dress. The 'tunica interior,' or what is here called tunica,' was a simple shift, and in early times had no sleeves. According to Nonius, it fitted loosely on the body, and was not girded when the 'stola' or outer tunic was put on. Poor people, who could not afford to purchase a 'toga,' wore the tunic alone; whence we find the lower classes called by the name of 'tunicati.'] [Footnote 056: Her flowing hair.--Ver. 10. 'Dividuis,' here means, that her hair was scattered, flowing over her shoulders and not arranged on the head in a knot.] [Footnote 057: Semiramis.--Ver. 11. Semiramis was the wife of Ninus, king of Babylon, and was famous for her extreme beauty, and the talent which she displayed as a ruler. She was also as unscrupulous in her morals as the fair one whom the Poet is now describing.] [Footnote 058: And Lais.--Ver. 12.

Semiramis was the wife of Ninus, king of Babylon, and was famous for her extreme beauty, and the talent which she displayed as a ruler. She was also as unscrupulous in her morals as the fair one whom the Poet is now describing.] [Footnote 058: And Lais.--Ver. 12. There are generally supposed to have beén two famous courtesans of the name of Lais. The first was carried captive, when a child, from Sicily, in the second year of the 91st Olympiad, and being taken to Corinth, became famous throughout Greece for her extreme beauty, and the high price she put upon her favours. Many of the richest and most learned men resorted to her, and became smitten by her charms. The second Lais was the daughter of Alcibiades, by his mistress, Timandra. When Demosthenes applied for a share of her favours, she made the extravagant demand of ten thousand drachmae, upon which, regaining his wisdom (which had certainly forsaken him for a time) he said that he would not purchase repentance at so high a price.] [Footnote 059: In its thinness.--Ver. 13. Possibly it was made of Coan cloth, if Corinna was as extravagant as she was vicious.] [Footnote 060: The cruel fetter--Ver. 1. Among the Romans, the porter was frequently bound by a chain to his post, that he might not forsake it.] [Footnote 062: Watches of the keepers.--Ver. 7. Properly, the 'excubiæ' were the military watches that were kept on guard, either by night or day, while the term 'vigiliæ,' was only applied to the watch by night. He here alludes to the watch kept by jealous men over their wives.] [Footnote 063: Spectres that flit by night.--Ver. 13. The dread of the ghosts of the departed entered largely among the Roman superstitions. See an account of the Ceremony, in the Fifth Book of the Fasti, 1. 422, et seq., for driving the ghosts, or Lemures, from the house.] [Footnote 064: Ready for the whip--Ver. 19. See the Note to the 81st line of the Epistle of De'ianira to Hercules. Ovid says, that he has often pleaded for him to his mistress; indeed, the Roman ladies often showed more cruelty to the slaves, both male and female, than the men did to the male slaves.] [Footnote 065: As you wish.--Ver. 28. Of course it would be the porter's wish that the night should pass quickly on, as he would be relieved in the morning, and was probably forbidden to sleep during the night.] [Footnote 066: Hours of the night pass on.--Ver. 24. This is an intercalary line, being repeated after each seventh one.] [Footnote 067: From the door-post.--Ver. 24. The fastenings of the Roman doors consisted of a bolt placed at the bottom of eacn 'foris,' or wing of the door, which fell into a socket made in the sill. By way of additional precaution, at night, the front door was secured by a bar of wood or iron, here called 'sera,' which ran across, and was inserted in sockets on each side of the doorway. Hence it was necessary to remove or strike away the bar, 'excutere seram,' before the door could be opened.] [Footnote 068: Water of the slave.--Ver. 26. Water was the principal beverage of the Roman slaves, but they were allowed a small quantity of wiue, which was increased on the Saturnalia. 'Far,' or 'spelt,' formed their general sustenance, of which they received one 'libra' daily. Salt and oil were also allowed them, and sometimes fruit, but seldom vegetables. Flesh meat seems not to have been given to them.] [Footnote 069: About my temples.--Ver. 37. 'Circa mea tempora,' literally, 'around my temples' This-expression is used, because it was supposed that the vapours of excessive wine affect the brain. He says that he has only taken a moderate quantity of wine, although the chaplet falling from off his hair would seem to bespeak the contrary.] [Footnote 073: Otherwise I myself!--Ver. 57. Heinsius thinks that this and the following line are spurious.] [Footnote 074: Holding in my torch--Ver. 58. Torches were usually carried by the Romans, for their guidance after sunset, and were generally made of wooden staves or twigs, bound by a rope around them, in a spiral form, or else by circular bands at equal distances. The inside of the torch was filled with flax, tow, or dead vegetable matter, impregnated with pitch, wax, rosin, oil, or other inflammable substances.] [Footnote 075: Love and wine.--Ver. 59.

It was mostly under ground, and, was lighted with narrow windows, too high from the ground to be touched with the hand. Slaves who had displeased their masters were usually sent there for a punishment, and those of uncouth habits were kept there. Plutarch says that they were established, on the conquest of Italy, in consequence of the number of foreign slaves imported for the cultivation of the conquered territory. They were finally abolished by the Emperor Hadrian.] [Footnote 077: Bird is arousing.--Ver. 66. The cock, whom the poets universally consider as 'the harbinger of morn.'] [Footnote 078: Equally slaves.--Ver. 74. He called the doors, which were bivalve or folding-doors, his 'conservæ,' or 'fellow' slaves,' from the fact of their being obedient to the will of a slave. Plautuâ, in the Asinaria, act. ii sc. 3, has a similar expression:--'Nolo ego fores, conservas meas a te verberarier.' 'I won't have my door, my fellow-slave, thumped by you.'] [Footnote 080: Did not Ajax too.--Ver. 7. Ajax Telamon, on being refused the arms of Achilles, became mad, and slaughtered a flock of sheep, fancying that they were the sons of Atreus, and his enemy Ulysses. His shield, formed of seven ox hides, is celebrated by Homer.] [Footnote 081: Mystic Goddesses.--Ver. 10. Orestes avenged the death of his father, Agamemnon, by slaying his own mother, Clytemnestra, together with her paramour, Ægistheus. He also attempted to attack the Furies, when they haunted him for the murder of his mother.] [Footnote 082: Daughter of Schceneus.--Ver. 13. Atalanta, the Arcadian, or Mae-nalian, was the daughter of Iasius, and was famous for her skill in the chase. Atalanta, the Boeotian, was the daughter of Schceneus, and was renowned for her swiftness, and for the race in which she was outstripped by Hippomenes. The Poet has here mistaken the one for the other, calling the Arcadian one the daughter of Schoeneus. The story of the Arcadian Atalanta is told in the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, and that of the daughter of Schceneus, at the end of the Tenth Book of the same work.] [Footnote 083: The Cretan damsel.--Ver. 16. Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, when deserted on the island of Naxos or Cea.] [Footnote 084: Cassandra.--Ver. 17. Cassandra being a priestess, would wear the sacred fillets, 'vittse.' She was ravished by Ajax Oileus, in the temple of Minerva.] [Footnote 085: The humblest Roman.--Ver. 29. It was not lawful to strike a freeborn human citizen. See Acts, c. xxii. v. 25. 'And as they hound him with thongs, Paul said unto the Centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemncd?' This privilege does not seem to have extended to Roman women of free birth.] [Footnote 086: Strike a Goddess.--Ver. 32. He alludes to the wound inflicted by Diomedes upon Venus, while protecting her son Æneas.] [Footnote 087: Her hurt cheeks--Ver. 40. He implies by this, to his disgrace which has made her cheeks black and blue by his violence.] [Footnote 089: At the middle.--Ver. 48. He says that he ought to have been satisfied with tearing her tunic down to the waist, where the girdle should have stopped short the rent; whereas, in all probability, he had torn it from the top to the bottom.] [Footnote 090: Her free-born cheeks.--Ver. 50. It was a common practice with many of the Romans, to tear and scratch their Slaves on the least provocation.] [Footnote 091: The Parian mountains.--Ver. 52. The marble of Paros was greatly esteemed for its extreme whiteness. Paros was one of the Cyclades, situate about eighteen miles from the island of Delos.] [Footnote 092: Their proper order. --Ver 68. 'In statione,' was originally a military phrase, signifying 'on guard'; from which It came to be applied to any thing in its place or in proper order.] [Footnote 094: Does she derive.--Ver. 3. He says that her name, 'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.] [Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver. 5.

He says that her name, 'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.] [Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver. 5. He alludes to the charms of Circe and Medea. According to Eustathius, Ææa was a city of Colchis.] [Footnote 096: Turns back to its source.--Ver. 6. This the magicians of ancient times generally professed to do.] [Footnote 097: Spinning wheel.--Ver. 8. 'Rhombus,' means a parallelogram with equal sides, but not having right angles, and hence, from the resemblance, a spinning wheel, or winder. The 'licia' were the cords or thrums of the old warp, or the threads of the old web to which the threads of the new warp were joined. Here, however, the word seems to mean the threads alone. The spinning-wheel was much used in magical incantations, not only among the Romans, but among the people of Northern and Western Europe. It is not improbable that the practice was founded on the so-called threads of destiny, and it was the province of the wizard, or sorceress, by his or her charms, to lengthen or shorten those threads, according as their customers might desire. Indeed, in some parts of Europe, at the present day, charms, in the shape of forms of words, are said to exist, which have power over the human life at any distance from the spot where they are uttered; a kind of superstition which dispenses with the more cumbrous paraphernalia of the spinning-wheel. Some Commentators think that the use of the 'licia' implied that the minds of individuals were to be influenced at the will of the enchanter, in the same way as the old thrums of the warp are caught up and held fast by the new threads; this view, however, seems to dispense with the province of the wheel in the incantation. See the Second Book of the Fasti, 1. 572. The old woman there mentioned as performing the rites of the Goddess, Tacita, among her other proceedings, 'binds the enchantea threads on the dark-coloured spinning-wheel.'] [Footnote 098: Venomous exudation.--Ver. 8. This was the substance called 'hippomanes,' which was said to flow from mares when in a prurient state. Hesiod says, that 'hippomanes' was a herb which produced madness in the horses that ate of it. Pliny, in his Eighth Book, says that it is a poisonous excrescence of the size of a fig, and of a black colour, which grows on the head of the mare, and which the foal at its birth is in the habit of biting off, which, if it neglects to do, it is not allowed by its mother to suck. This fictitious substance was said to be especially used in philtres.] [Footnote 099: Moon was empurpled.--Ver. 12. If such a thing as a fog ever exists in Italy, he may very possibly have seen the moon of a deep red colour.] [Footnote 101: That she, transformed.--Ver. 13. 'Versam,' 'transformed,' seems here to be a preferable reading to 'vivam,' 'alive.' Burmann, however, thinks that the 'striges' were the ghosts of dead sorcerers and wizards, and that the Poet means here, that Dipsas had the power of transforming herself into a 'strix' even while living, and that consequently 'vivam' is the proper reading. The 'strix' was a fabulous bird of the owl kind, which was said to suck the blood of children in the cradle. Seethe Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 141, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 102: A double pupil, too.--Ver. 15. The pupil, or apple of the eye, is that part through which light is conveyed to the optic nerve. Some persons, especially females, were said by the ancients to have a double pupil, which constituted what was called 'the evil eye.' Pliny the Elder says, in his Seventh Book, that 'all women injure by their glances, who have a double pupil.' The grammarian, Haephestion, tells us, in his Fifth Book, that the wife of Candaulcs, king of Lydia, had a double pupil. Heinsius suggests, that this was possibly the case with the Ialysian Telchines, mentioned in the Seventh Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 365, 'whose eyes corrupting all things by the very looking upon them, Jupiter, utterly hating, thrust them beneath the waves of his brother.'] [Footnote 103: And their grandsires.--Ver. 17. One hypercritical Commentator here makes this remark: 'As though it were any more difficult to summon forth from the tomb those who have long been dead, than those who are iust deceased.'

He forgot that Ovid had to make up his line, and that 'antiquis proavos atavosque' made three good feet, and two-thirds of another.] [Footnote 105: The twofold doors.--Ver. 20. The doors used by the ancients were mostly bivalve, or folding doors.] [Footnote 106: Mars in opposition.--Ver. 29. She is dabbling here in astrology, and the adverse and favourable aspects of the stars. We are to suppose that she is the agent of the young man who has seen the damsel, and she is telling her that the rising star of Venus is about to bring her good luck.] [Footnote 107: Makes it his care.--Ver. 32. Burmann thinks that this line, as it stands at present, is not pure Latin; and, indeed, 'curæ habet,' 'makes it his care,' seems a very unusual mode of expression. He suggests another reading--'et, cultæ quod tibi défit, habet,' 'and he possesses that which is wanting for your being well-dressed,' namely, money.] [Footnote 108: The damsel blushed.--Ver. 35. He says that his mistress blusned at the remark of the old hag, that the young man was worthy to be purchased by her, if he had not been the first to make an offer. We must suppose that here the Poet peeped through a chink of the door, as he was on the other side, listening to the discourse; or he may have reasonably guessed that she did so, from the remark made in the same line by the old woman.] [Footnote 109: Your eyes cast down.--Ver. 37. The old woman seems to be advising her to pretend modesty, by looking down on her lap, so as not to give away even a look, until she has seen what is deposited there, and then only to give gracious glances in proportion to her present. It was the custom for the young simpletons who lavished their money on the Roman courtesans, to place their presents in the lap or bosom.] [Footnote 111: Sabine females.--Ver. 39. The Sabines were noted for their domestic virtues. The hag hints, that the chastity of the Sabine women was only the result of their want of good breeding. 'Tatio régnante' seems to point to the good old times, in the same way as our old songsters have it, 'When good king Arthur reigned.' Tatius reigned jointly at Rome with Romulus. See the Fourteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 804.] [Footnote 112: In foreign warfare.--Ver. 41. She says, that they are now in a more civilized state, than when they were fighting just without the walls of Rome; now they are solely engaged in foreign conquests, and Venus reigns in the city of the descendants of her son, Æneas.] [Footnote 113: Dispel these frowns.--Ver. 45. The damsel has, probably, frowned here at her last remark, on which she tells her she must learn to dispense with these frowns, and that when she dispels them, 'excutit,' so many faults which might otherwise prove to her disadvantage, will be well got rid of.] [Footnote 114: Penelope used to try.--Ver. 47. Penelope, in order that she might escape the importunity of the suitors, proposed that they should try to bend the bow of Ulysses, promising her hand to him who should prove successful. The hag, however, says that, with all her pretended chastity, Penelope only wanted to find out who was the most stalwart man among her lovers, in order that she might choose him for a husbaud.] [Footnote 116: Graceful in his mantle.--Ver. 59. The 'palla' was especially worn by musicians. She is supposed to refer to the statue of Apollo, which was erected on the Palatine Hill by Augustus; and her design seems to be, to shew that poetry and riches are not so incompatible as the girl may, from her lover's poverty, be led to imagine.] [Footnote 117: At a price for his person.--Ver. 63. That is to say, some rich slave who has bought his own liberty. As many of the Roman slaves were skilful at various trades and handicrafts, and were probably allowed the profits of their work after certain hours in the day, it would be no uncommon thing for a slave, with his earnings, to purchase his liberty. Some of the slaves practised as physicians, while others followed the occupation of literary men.] [Footnote 118: Rubbed with chalk.--Ver. 64. It was the custom to mark with chalk, 'gypsum,' the feet of such slaves as were newly imported for sale.] [Footnote 119: Busts about the halls.--Ver. 65. Instead of 'quinquatria,' which is evidently a corrupt reading, 'circum atria' has been adopted. She is advising the girl not to be led away by notions of nobility, founded on the number of 'ceræ,' or waxen busts of their ancestors, that adorned the 'atria,' or halls of her admirers. See the Fasti, Book i. line 591, and the Note to the passage; also the Epistle of Laodamia to Protesilaus, line 152.] [Footnote 120: Nay, more, should.--Ver. 67.

'Quin' seems to be a preferable reading to-'quid?'] [Footnote 121: There will be Isis.--Ver. 74. The Roman women celebrated the festival of Isis for several successive days, and during that period they care-fully abstained from the society of men.] [Footnote 127: By your censure.--Ver. 80. When she has offended she is to pretend a counter grievance, so as to outweigh her faults.] [Footnote 128: A deaf hearing.--Ver. 86. Literally, 'deaf Godhead.'] [Footnote 129: A crafty handmaid.--Ver. 87. The comedies of Plautus and Terence show the part which the intriguing slaves and handmaids acted on such occasions.] [Footnote 130: A little of many.--Ver. 89. 'Multos,' as suggested by Heinsius, is preferable to 'multi,' which does not suit the sense.] [Footnote 131: Heap from the gleanings--Ver. 90. 'Stipula' here means 'gleanings.' She says, that each of the servants must ask for a little, and those little sums put together will make a decent amount collected from her lovers. No doubt her meaning is, that the mistress should pocket the presents thus made to the slaves.] [Footnote 132: With a cake.--Ver. 94. The old woman tells how, when she has exhausted all other excuses for getting a present, to have the birth-day cake by her, and to pretend that it is her birth-day; in order that her lover may take the hint, and present her with a gift. The birth-day cake, according to Servius, was made of flour and honey; and being set on tabic before the guests, the person whose birth-day it was, ate the first slice, after which the others partook of it, and wished him happiness and prosperity. Presents, too, were generally made on birth-days.] [Footnote 133: The Sacred Street.\"--Ver. 100. The 'via sacra,' or' Sacred Street, from the old Senate house at Rome towards the Amphitheatre, and up the Capitoline hill. For the sale of all kinds of luxuries, it seems to have had the same rank in Rome that Regent Street holds in London. The procuress tells her, that if her admirer makes no presents, she must turn the conversation to the 'Via Sacra;' of course, asking him such questions as, What is to be bought there? What is the price of such and such a thing? And then she is to say, that she is in want of this or that, but unfortunately she has no money, &c.] [Footnote 134: Conceal your thoughts.--Ver. 103. This expression resembles the famous one attributed to Machiavelli, that 'speech was made for the concealment of the thoughts.'] [Footnote 134: Prove his ruin.--Ver. 103. 'Let your lips utter kind things, but let it be your intention to ruin him outright by your extravagance.'] [Footnote 135: Grant thee both no home--Ver. 113. The 'Lares,' being the household Gods, 'nullos Lares,' implies 'no home.'] [Footnote 136: Everlasting thirst.--Ver. 114. In allusion to her thirsty name; see the Note to the second line.] [Footnote 138: Atticus.--Ver. 2. It is supposed that this Atticus was the same person to whom Ovid addresses the Fourth and Seventh Pontic Epistle in the Second Book. It certainly was not Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who died when the Poet was in his eleventh year.] [Footnote 139: The years which.\"--Ver. 5. The age for serving in the Roman armies, was from the seventeenth up to the forty-sixth year.] [Footnote 140: Of his general.--Ver. 8. He alludes to the four night-watches of the Roman army, which succeeded each other every three hours. Each guard, or watch, consisted of four men, of whom one acted as sentry, while the others were in readiness, in case of alarm.] [Footnote 142: The othert doors.--Ver. 20. From the writings of Terence and Plautus, as well as those of Ovid, we find that the youths of Rome were not very scrupulous about kicking down the door of an obdurate mistress.] [Footnote 143: Thracian Rhesits.--Ver. 23.

It is hard to say whether the word 'Desinat' means 'Let him leave off saying so,' or 'Let him cease to love': perhaps the latter is the preferable mode of rendering it.] [Footnote 146: The raving prophetess.--Ver. 38. 'Mænas' literally means 'a raving female,' from the Greek word paivopai, 'to be mad.' He alludes to Cassandra when inspired with the prophetic spirit.] [Footnote 147: At the forge.--Ver. 39. When he was detected by means of the iron net, as related in the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 148: A lazy inactivity.--Ver. 41. When persons wished to be at ease in their leisure moments at home, they were in the habit of loosening the girdle which fastened the tunic; from this circumstance, the term 'dis-cinctus' is peculiarly applied to a state of indolence.] [Footnote 149: Couch and the shade.--Ver. 42. 'Lectus et umbra' means 'lying in bed and reclining in the shade.' The shade of foliage would have peculiar attractions in the cloudless climate of Italy, especially for persons naturally inclined to be idle.] [Footnote 150: To serve.--Ver. 44. 'Æra merere' has the same meaning as 'stipendum merere,' 'to earn the pay of a soldier,' whence it came to signify 'to sene as a soldier.' The ancient accounts differ materially as to the pay which the Roman soldiers received.] [Footnote 151: The Eurotas.--Ver. 1. The Eurotas was the river which flowed past the walls of Sparta. He is alluding to Helen.] [Footnote 152: Amymone.--Ver. 5. She was one of the Danaides, and was carrying water, when she was attacked by a Satyr, and rescued by Neptune. See the Epistle of Hero to Leander, 1. 131, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 153: Fold in his dress.--Ver. 18. The 'sinhs' of the 'toga,' among the men, and of the 'palla,' among the women, which extended in folds across the breast, was used as a pocket, in which they carried money, purses, letters, and other articles. When the party was seated, the 'sinus' would almost correspond in meaning with our word 'lap.'] [Footnote 154: Avaricious procurer.--Ver. 23. 'Leno' was a person who kept a house for the purposes of prostitution, and who generally robbed his victims of the profits of their unfortunate calling. This was called 'lenocinium,' and the trade was not forbidden, though the 'lenones' were considered 'infames,' or 'disgraced,' and thereby lost certain political rights.] [Footnote 155: By compulsion.--Ver. 24. Being probably the slave of the 'leno,' he would use force to make her comply with his commands.] [Footnote 156: Hired dishonestly.--Ver. 37. The evidence of witnesses was taken by the Praetor, and was called 'jusjurandum in judicio,' whereas the evidence of parties themselves was termed 'jusjurandum in jure.' It was given on oath by such as the Praetor or other judge chose to call, or as either party might propose for examination.] [Footnote 157: The chest.--Ver. 38. The 'area' here means the strong box, or chest, in which the Romans were accustomed to place their money; they were generally made of, or bound with, iron or other metal.] [Footnote 158: Commissioned judge.--Ver. 38. The 'judices selecti' were the 'cen-tumviri,' a body of one hundred and five officers, whose duty it was to assist the Praetor in questions where the right to property was litigated. In the Second Book of the Tristia, 1. 93, we are informed that the Poet himself filled the office of a 'judex selectus.'] [Footnote 159: That is purchased.--Ver. 39. Among the Romans, the 'patroni' defended their 'clientes' gratuitously, and it would have been deemed disgraceful for them to take a fee or present.] [Footnote 160: He who hires.--Ver. 45. The 'conductor' was properly the person who hired the services, or the property of another, for a fixed price. The word sometimes means 'a contractor,' or the person with whom the bargain by the former party is made. See the public contract mentioned in the Fasti, Book v. 1. 293.] [Footnote 161: The Sabine bracelets.--Ver. 49. He alludes to the fate of the Vestal virgin Tarpeia. See the Fasti, Book i. 1. 261, and Note; also the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p. 516.] [Footnote 163: The son pierced.--Ver. 52. Alcmæon killed his mother Eriphyle, for having betrayed his father Amphiaraus. See the Second Book of the Fasti, 1. 43, and the Third Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. i. 1. 52, and the Notes to the passages.] [Footnote 164: A simple necklace.--Ver. 52.

The fertile gardens of Alcinoiis, king of the Phæacians, are celebrated by Homer in the Odyssey.] [Footnote 166: The straggling locks.--Ver. 1. The duty of dressing the hair of the Roman ladies was divided among several slaves, who were called by the general terms of 'cosmetæ,' and 'omatrices.' It was the province of one to curl the hair with a hot iron, called 'calamistrum,' which was hollow, and was heated in wood ashes by a slave who, from 'cinis,' 'ashes,' was called 'ciniflo.' The duty of the 'psecas' came next, whose place it was to anoint the hair. Then came that of the 'ornatrix,' who parted the curls with a comb or bodkin; this seems to have been the province of Napè.] [Footnote 167: To be reckoned.--Ver. 2. The Nymphs of the groves were called [Footnote vanâtai ]; and perhaps from them Nape received her name, as it is evidently of Greek origin. One of the dogs of Actæon is called by the same name, in the Metamorphoses, Book iii. 1. 214.] [Footnote 168: Giving the signale.--Ver. 4. 'Notis' may mean here, either 'hints,] 'signs,' 'signals.' or 'letters.' In Nizard's French translation it is rendered 'missives.'] [Footnote 169: Carry these tablets.--Ver. 7. On the wax tablets, see the Note to the Pontic Epistles, Book ii. El. 9.1. 69, and the Metamorphoses, Book ix. 1. 521, with the Note.] [Footnote 170: So well filled.--Ver. 7. 'Peraratas' literally means 'ploughed over'; which term is properly applied to the action of the 'stylus,' in ploughing through the wax upon the tablets. Suetonius relates that Julius Caesar, when he was murdered in the Senate House, pierced the arm af the assassin Cassius with his 'stylus.'] [Footnote 172: A long answer.--Ver. 19. She is to write at once, on having read his letter through. This she could do the more readily, as she could use the same tablets, smoothing the wax with the broad end of the 'graphium,' or 'stylus.'] [Footnote 175: Holding the pen.--Ver. 23. 'Graphium' was the Greek name for the 'stylus,' or pen used for writing on the wax tablets. It was generally of iron or copper, but sometimes of gold. The case in which it was kept was called 'graphiarium,' or 'graphiaria theca.'] [Footnote 176: Of worthless maple.--Ver. 28. He calls the wood of the tablets 'vile,' in comparison with their great services to him: for, according to Pliny, Book xvi. c. 15, maple was the most valued wood for tablets, next to 'citrus,' cedar, or citron wood. It was also more useful than citron, because it could be cut into leaves, or laminae, of a larger size than citron would admit of.] [Footnote 178: Struck her foot.--Ver. 4. This is mentioned as a bad omen by Laodamia, in her Epistle to Protesilaüs, 1. 88. So in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses, in the shocking story of Cinyras and Myrrha; Three times was she recalled by the presage of her foot stumbling.'] [Footnote 180: The Corsican lee.--Ver. 10. From Pliny, Book xvi., we learn that the honey of Corsica was of a bitter taste, in consequence of the box-trees and yews, with which the isle abounded, and which latter, according to him, were poisonous. From Diodorus Siculus we learn that there were many turpentine trees on the island; this would not tend to improve the flavour of the honey.] [Footnote 181: Dyed in vermilion.--Ver. 11. 'Minium,' 'red lead,' or 'vermilion,' was discovered by Callias, an Athenian, according to Theophrastus. It was sometimes mixed with the wax used for tablets: probably not the best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour. This censure of the tablets is a good illustration of the grapes being sour. In the last Elegy, before he has received his repulse, he declares the wax to be 'splen-dida,' 'of brilliaut whiteness through bleaching;' now, on the other hand, he finds, most ominously, that it is as red as blood.] [Footnote 182: Dreadful crosses.--Ver.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "eJwN0vdbVecBwHGEBkEUG2Rc7jzzPe85FyNVUalKgiI2rmgdxBkcRWvVuEARxac+oIkYEWTDvffM97zncHGl+DijljgoEho0FffAiKPOJkaGpvkLvj98vjp1kclRnkoJYqueClribhZiejM6xSxxjPC9tkQbBUYD2mgwBTl4pTmEefj+dW3swBzbNvkCzmdnwQPMl44MtboiSAtReVt7HalVCtfYQUYqzGK2o/k42V+niShaBVQ2t05L8hKwXolkBnsXeT5FK+zYzEAfqc/Ib+VMUAUc+KktSFMD680PK6brhXQv6arnnzWOQV24oTKNDLaOUq4yHfAzXxT7jBxHsngJnhH7HF2kOswLLEMEG6HMz/DSb/VAMUHuJYSrTSyLl8lPUAHDx05mmkQfPAUScVEsITxidOuV6md52bpV2Kfnc0ep9eBX0kKMViYo+7lVIEGYLA6jvGSsekQfAT/XwuR+O5eCz2C04dACYIFtraOb+4k7aj/G78XnQQh6xO6C86SDVD57hgtzUJYv6FC8gzxQkuTpdMvux+Awn6IuwpfDdzunGC3cflUkI5grbJp7DcoxyuB8Bqi7lGQlCI4EmShFzaMe6tOjW6u3c6PMA/ga8MptbCqbIM0jJ4Ov5N2V4UYu9MZsCP6HAcpUdEhRJCUiAE5UiNJOs2zQEa0abTYKbO/Uy/RHbDDf5VuCM2zt+nOjIo7aVQWc0kniW7kPmuXZKLcrzf5Moh1dZbPVncwbXFNxkguVy9DXSr/oj8EZbi05n35rurVXei3ujJ7tmwg+qJ1aMQ/PcJ4pmqjFC800Cb30tMosyzIzz10qZ6MEan/tvUP30Y/sRk9DtOL5hvypNDTS6Y8yz+4Plqcbo+FdroH/vOaobV2t0zmWHgWbwDH+ts1LnAZtKJ9a2j8WbjaijVeuXmwc2y12Mt2+JdYQoTdqNIaBZjE/7DXV257LDvWd4Md4GuiQ8tf0a3DdWQ2Xwi+M1XXNuEQbyJcRw3xp6AN7hxRJjKwaJ13AGhNfsgD/wu5S/173nM5havC24tn2tY4HtRvMld70hGRijjJTcpIGe8OVFVuol8Uu4JJdgSCYWMDfisvFHnmrukf5ixhgvmMPR6b4Q8l6LDvuq01auLzUeg7PRVDZ51xrRNY6UAT62JqjXiqzsruNaLUPkSteU9O18fAKyNOziCGGByB8iPBqVmY15NibKmKEqO6Kvmi61u6dTzfyB6nDLgY3UKO5Wcy/QB9LHV0U1cHeI1IJDaRwbe/PpSeob/Tz5Kbq2WihzhPZOIP5xJ8IulEXOVfZSh5TUpj+qiRtIGrxW0saYMvP0SUyx09llkMn7HI8gtfKKoyBbA89iI7H23zt9juF4doeSyAbV2tTXulf6Ze5Hv141UM4Tjgk68jN7dXuFeXLaWiuluZ8R7ZJg/lnYqB3MPGN9ICM1zg9uXiOewbcyY+LOcWN7hPPO23p4I9cszGJjAEN7C3dV3qfczlNcgOUY2zcctso42/vxSkn6KF0oxbMX+b/aklS/cx1VOvw2PqLv7c/E4Z7vgOrhFbBqT5idgvBrNVfCjKJ7+2fKo/1CNOocHAZYgNOwkP1X4tFI8a4zQNtnXjYWF06QT1f0xu91B6XtKKsmisONw7gPa4x3kuxPLxTaYterPUF9dR4fN+1h3D5x6DN8BpooVLUD9FK7ilwUf+ruidnE21gsP5dbS1z0hjiHGn06J/IQ3xPPeMlvzOfXkEd9su4Dd3QkLoGpUsrvAbqUGYSid6NuIYeAs7x4/25wkJ4g6kHTr5fZLOeaU1i/MQA+Fa0qDMdF43F2ojfadiONymDS3+wyZrokFS/li8yeBn1wrrNKYpdegde7kR8uPRKFcSB7tNKFVroeC4dYFJhLLMOAHCWmkZRei9xK3vB2mXMBMvVFu8T8gifxK6v+Y+nmOiGiVxjxF6t2bpXOmcsQu1cD3/RnKcWqJ2o3W7qDDdBXywPIyfKhPkWNkmj7W1goCNBSEaU8AfvKvLC/rHMJCNM12GJnWNeaBIizS1xJ4g3RJ56yjWU3+LY517D3hNyKd1oMV9qpQOyuLPqJstCsYZ9AS4VjtB/4WnbDmaL/B6eyiI+lAvx3EWno3RnOh6lFzE2+ols33fZY4sbC+u9HvdwdQkqZ/4k1ChNxM2oY+odIsA1235CmtjvzG9/Y7TaXoubmQP61/RJ3J+m0KqaPThUWQ+3w0o2Rr2rKr4SY40ZwtfgEnuoOYc5yxq+ASS2/ZcN4rfa07xJQirsZWxwnjT/7LtINhuBZoY9TJ1eVegpZqexU2APDITJOMisZBP1AIeu9/CWLxvZViaPOihnYqfaHim647l0HIES4yhfg/HGpIgxQgQqr+gEbZLbQrGaq19VCJ4l7PAfkbYKBleJMukp3hZ9gjhCpI1bwgsqSF3KZ2qNXAhbjhsKZzOVXJjUqqT7S9wvcbNb08JVAVgRwb3RLGwleYcuBz/7TjFh6gpYrD4wi8xROFscKR0nN6Nj3u+J29Iko0vr4e/DH+FxYiz5VtwnNIO99r5xUPtBnR9VTd39Tc+OinErqIPDWYXd5jvDqThPoJh/ay/0Bx4K32L+D9p5hWQ="}, {"__id__": "chunk-5208b8728c96888e457d542e0fba49b2", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour.

In the last Elegy, before he has received his repulse, he declares the wax to be 'splen-dida,' 'of brilliaut whiteness through bleaching;' now, on the other hand, he finds, most ominously, that it is as red as blood.] [Footnote 182: Dreadful crosses.--Ver. 18. See the First Book of the Pontic Epistlea, Ep. vi. 1. 38, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 183: The screech-owl.--Ver. 20. 'Strix' here means a screech-owl; and not the fabulous bird referred to under that name, in the Sixth Book of the Fasti, and the thirteenth line of the Eighth Elegy of this Book.] [Footnote 184: The prosy summons.--Ver. 23. 'Vadimonium legere' probably means, 'to call a man on his bail' or 'recognizances.' When the Praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the defendant to give security for his appearance on the day named. The defendant, on finding a surety, was said 'vades dare,' or 'vadimonium facere': and the 'vas,' or surety, was said 'spondere.' The plaintiff, if satisfied with the surety, was said 'vadari reum,' 'to let the defendant go on his sureties.'] [Footnote 185: Some judge.--Ver. 24. Some Commentators think that the word 'cognitor' here means, the attorney, or procurator of the plaintiff, who might, in his absence, carry on the cause for him. In that case they would translate 'duro,' 'shameless,' or 'impudent.' But another meaning of the word 'cognitor' is 'a judge,' or 'commissioner,' and such seems to be the meaning here, in which case 'duras' will mean 'severe,' or 'sour;' 'as,' according to one Commentator, 'judges are wont to be.' Much better would they lie amid diaries and day-books, [186] over which the avaricious huncks might lament his squandered substance. And have I then in reality as well as in name found you full of duplicity? [187] The very number _of you_ was not one of good omen. What, in my anger, ought I to pray, but that an old age of rottenness may consume you, and that your wax may be white with nasty mould?] [Footnote 186: And day-books.--Ver. 25. Seneca, at the end of his 19th Epistle, calls a Calendar by the name of 'Ephemeris,' while a day-book is meant by the term as used by Ausonius. The word here seems to mean a 'diary;' while 'tabula' is perhaps a 'day-book,' in which current expenses are set down, and over which the miser weeps, as the record of past extravagance.] [Footnote 187: Full of duplicity.--Ver. 27. The word 'duplex' means either 'double,' or 'deceitful,' according to the context. He plays on this twofold meaning, and says that double though they might be, still truly deceitful they were; and that the two leaves of the tablets were of no good omen to him. Two-leaved tablets were technically called 'diptycha.'] [Footnote 189: Honour the shades.--Ver. 4. 'Parento' means 'to celebrate the funeral obsequies of one's parents.' Both the Romans and the Greeks were accustomed to visit the tombs of their relatives at certain times, and to offer sacrifices, called 'inferiæ,' or 'parentalia.' The souls of the departed were regarded by the Romans as Gods, and the oblations to them consisted of milk, wine, victims, or wreaths of flowers. The Poet here refers to the birds which arose from the funeral pile of Memnon, and wera said to revisit it annually. See the Thirteenth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 190: Moisture is cooling.--Ver. 7. 'Humor' seems to mean the dew, or the dampness of the night, which would tend, in a hot climate, to modify the sultriness of the atmosphere. One Commentator thinks that the word means the humours of the brain.] [Footnote 192: To their masters.--Ver. 17. The schools at Rome were mostly kept by manumitted slaves; and we learn from the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 829, that people were not very particular about paying them.] [Footnote 193: The cruel stripes.--Ver. 18. The punishment here mentioned was generally inflicted on the hands of the Roman school-boys, with a 'ferula,' or stalk of giant-fennel, as we learn from Juvenal, Satire 1.] [Footnote 194: The attorney.--Ver. 19. The business of the 'jurisconsultus' was to expound and give opinions on the law, much like the chamber counsel of the present day. They were also known by the name of 'juris periti,' or 'consulti' only. Cicero gives this definition of the duty of a 'consultus.'] 'He is à person who has such a knowledge of the laws and customs which prevail in a state, as to be able to advise, and secure a person in", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-b6cab761408cb58a952d84a4e27dce81", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "The business of the 'jurisconsultus' was to expound and give opinions on the law, much like the chamber counsel of the present day.

They advised their clients gratuitously, either in public places, or at their own houses. They also drew up wills and contracts, as in the present instance.] [Footnote 195: To become bail.--Ver. 19. This passage has given much trouble to the Commentators, but it has been well explained by Burmann, whose ideas on the subject are here adopted. The word 'sponsum' has been generally looked upon here as a noun substantive, whereas it is the active supine of the verb 'spondeo,' 'to become bail' or 'security.' The meaning then is, that some rise early, that they may go and become bail for a friend, and thereby incur risk and inconvenience, through uttering a single word, 'spondeo,' 'I become security,' which was the formula used. The obligation was coutracted orally, and for the purpose of evidencing it, witnesses were necessary; for this reason the undertaking was given, as in the present instance, in the presence of a 'jurisconsultus.'] [Footnote 198: To the pleader.--Ver. 21. 'Causidicus' was the person who pleads the cause of his client in court before the Prætor or other judges.] [Footnote 199: What if.--Ver. 33. Heinsius and other Commentators think that this line and the next are spurious. The story of Cephalus and Procris is related at the close of the Seventh Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 201: The Moon gave.--Ver. 43. Ovid says that Diana sent the sleep upon Endymion, whereas it was Jupiter who did so, as a punishment for his passion for Juno; he alludes to the youthfulness of the favorite of Diana, antithetically to the old age of Tithonus, the husband of Aurora.] [Footnote 202: Two nights together.--Ver. 46. When he slept with Acmena, under the form of her husband Amphion.] [Footnote 203: Doctoring your hair.--Ver. 1. Among the ancient Greeks, black hair was the most frequent, but that of a blonde colour was most valued. It was not uncommon with them to dye it when turning grey, so as to make it a black or blonde colour, according to the requirement of the case. Blonde hair was much esteemed by the Romans, and the ladies were in the habit of washing their hair with a composition to make it of this colour. This was called 'spuma caustica,' or, 'caustic soap,' wich was first used by the Gauls and Germans; from its name, it was probably the substance which had been used inthe present instance.] [Footnote 204: So far as ever.--Ver. 4. By this he means as low as her ancles.] [Footnote 205: Afraid to dress.--Ver. 5. He means to say, that it was so fine that she did not dare to curl it, for fear of injuring it.] [Footnote 206: Just like the veils.--Ver. 6. Burmann thinks that 'fila,' 'threads,' is better here than 'vela,' and that it is the correct reading. The swarthy Seres here mentioned, were perhaps the Chinese, who probably began to import their silks into Rome about this period. The mode of producing silk does not seem to have been known to Virgil, who speaks, in the Second Book of the Georgies, of the Seres combing it off the leaves of trees. Pliny also, in his Sixth Book, gives the same account. Ovid, however, seems to refer to silkworms under the name of 'agrestes tineæ,' in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 372.] [Footnote 208: Neither the bodkin.--Ver. 15. This was the 'discerniculum,' a 'bodkin,' which was used in parting the hair.] [Footnote 210: Bid the bodkin.--Ver. 18. The 'acus' here mentioned, was probably the 'discemicirium,' and not the 'crinale,' or hair-pin that was worn in the hair; as the latter was worn when the hair was bound up at the back of the head; whereas, judging from the length of the hair of his mistress, she most probably wore it in ringlets. He says that he never saw her snatch up the bodkin and stick it in the arm of the 'ornatrix.'] [Footnote 211: Iron and the fire.--Ver. 25. He alludes to the unnecessary application of the curling-iron to hair which naturally curled so well.] [Footnote 212: The very locks instruct.--Ver. 30.

Because they naturally assume as advantageous an appearance as the bodkin could possibly give them, when arranged with the utmost skill.] [Footnote 213: Dione is painted.--Ver. 34. Pliny, book xxxv. c. 4, mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as rising from the sea. It was placed, by Augustus, in the temple of Julius Caesar; and the lower part having become decayed, no one could be found of sufficient ability to repair it.] [Footnote 214: Lay down the mirror.--Ver. 16. The mirror was usually held by the 'ornatrix,' while her mistress arranged her hair.] [Footnote 215: Herbs of a rival.--Ver. 39. No person would be more likely than the 'pellex,' or concubine, to resort to charms and drugs, for the purpose of destroying the good looks of the married woman whose husband she wishes to retain.] [Footnote 216: All bad omens.--Ver. 41. So superstitious were the Romans, that the very mention of death, or disease, was deemed ominous of ill.] [Footnote 217: Germany will be sending.--Ver 45. Germany having been lately conquered by the arms of Augustus, he says that she must wear false hair, taken from the German captives. It was the custom to cut short the locks of the captives, and the German women were famed for the beauty of their hair.] [Footnote 218: Sygambrian girl.--Ver. 49. The Sygambri were a people of Ger many, living on the banks of the rivers Lippe and Weser.] [Footnote 219: For that spot.--Ver. 53. She carries a lock of the hair, which had fallen off, in her bosom.] [Footnote 221: My tongue for hire.--Ver. 6. Although the 'patronus pleaded the cause of the 'cliens,' without reward, still, by the use of the word 'pros-tituisse,' Ovid implies that the services of the advocate were often sold at a price. It must be remembered, that Ovid had been educated for the Roman bar, which he had left in disgust.] [Footnote 222: Mæonian bard.--Ver. 9. Strabo says, that Homer was a native of Smyrna, which was a city of Maeonia, a province of Phrygia. But Plutarch says, that he was called 'Maeonius,' from Maeon, a king of Lydia, who adopted him as his son.] [Footnote 223: Tenedos and Ida.--Ver. 10. Tenedos, Ida, and Simois, were the scenes of some portions of the Homeric narrative. The first was near Troy, in sight of it, as Virgil says--'est in conspectu Tenedos.'] [Footnote 224: The Ascræan, tool--Ver. 11. Hesiod of Ascræa, in Boeotia, wrote chieflv upon agricultural subjects. See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. ep. xiv. 1. 38.] [Footnote 225: With its juices.--Ver. 11. The 'mustum' was the pure jidcc of the grape before it was boiled down and became 'sapa,' or 'defrutum.' See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 779, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 226: The son of Battus.--Ver. 13. As to the poet Callimachus, the son of Battus, see the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 367, and the Ibis, 1. 55.] [Footnote 227: To the tragic buskin.--Ver. 15. On the 'cothurnus,' or 'buskin,' see the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 393, and the Note to the passage. Sophocles was one of the most famous of the Athenian Tragedians. He is supposed to have composed more than one hundred and twenty tragedies, of which only seven are remaining.] [Footnote 228: Aratus.--Ver. 16. Aratus was a Greek poet, a native of Cilicia, in Asia Minor. He wrote some astronomical poems, of which one, called 'Phænomena,' still exists. His style is condemned by Quintilian, although it is here praised by Ovid. His 'Phænomena' was translated into Latin by Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Sextus Avienus.] [Footnote 229: The deceitful slave.--Ver. 17. Although the plays of Menander have perished, we can judge from Terence and Plautus, how well he depicted the craftiness of the slave, the severity of the father, the dishonesty of the procuress, and the wheedling ways of the courtesan. Four of the plays of Terence are translations from Menander. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 369, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 230: Ennius.--Ver. 19. Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a Calabrian by birth. He flourished about 408 years before Christ. The few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth nature of his style. He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.] [Footnote 231: Accius.--Ver. 19.

Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a Calabrian by birth. He flourished about 408 years before Christ. The few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth nature of his style. He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.] [Footnote 231: Accius.--Ver. 19. See the Second Book of the Tristia, 1. 359, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 232: Of Varro.--Ver. 21. He refers to Publius Terentius Varro Attacinus, who wrote on the Argonautic expedition. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 439, and the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 21.] [Footnote 233: Lucretius.--Ver. 23. Titus Lucretius Carus is referred to, whose noble poem on the Epicurean philosophy is still in existence (translated in Bohn's Classical Library). See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 261 and 426, and the Notes to those passages.] [Footnote 234: Tityrus.--Ver. 25. Under this name he alludes to Virgil, who introduces himself under the name of Tityrus, in his first Eclogue, See the Pontic Epistles, Boek iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 33.] [Footnote 235: So long as thou, Rome.--Ver. 26. His prophecy has been surpassed by the event. Rome is no longer the 'caput urbis,' but the works of Virgil are still read by all civilized nations.] [Footnote 236: Polished Tibullus.--Ver. 28. Albius Tibullus was a Roman poet of Equestrian rank, famous for the beauty of his compositions. He was born in the same year as Ovid, but died at an early age. Ovid mentions him in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 447 and 463, Book iv. Ep. x. 1. 52, and Book v. Ep. i. 1. 18. In the Third Book of the Amores, El. 9, will be found his Lament on the death of Tibullus.] [Footnote 237: Gallus --Ver. 29. Cornelius Gallus was a Roman poet of considerable merit. See the Tristia, Book ii 1. 445, and the Note to the passage, and the Amores, Book iii. El. 1.] [Footnote 238: By the East.--Ver. 29. Gallus was the Roman governor of Egypt, which was an Eastern province of Rome.] [Footnote 239: The golden Tagus.--Ver. 34. Pliny and other authors make mention of the golden sands of the Tagus, which flowed through the province of Lusitania, now Portugal.] [Footnote 240: The closing fire.--Ver. 41. Pliny says that the ancient Romans buried the dead; but in consequence of the bones being disturbed by continual warfare, they adopted the system of burning them.] FOOTNOTES BOOK TWO: [Footnote 301: The watery Peligni.--Ver. 1. In the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1. 81, and the Fourth Book of the Tristia, 1. x. El. 3, he mentions Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, as the place of his birth. It was noted for its many streams or rivulets.] [Footnote 302: And Gyges.--Ver. 12. This giant was more generally called Gyas. He and his hundred-handed brothers, Briareus and Cæus, were the sons of Coelus and Terra.] [Footnote 303: Verses bring down.--Ver. 23. He alludes to the power of magic spells, and attributes their efficacy to their being couched in poetic measures; from which circumstance they received the name of 'carmina.'] [Footnote 304: And by verses.--Ver. 28. He means to say that in the same manner as magic spells have brought down the moon, arrested the sun, and turned back rivers towards their source, so have his Elegiac strains been as wonderfully successful in softening the obduracy of his mistress.] [Footnote 305: Bagous.--Ver. 1. The name Bagoas, or, as it is here Latinized. Bagous, is said to have signified, in the Persian language, 'an eunuch.' It was probably of Chaldæan origin, having that meaning. As among the Eastern nations of the present day, the more jealous of the Romans confided the care of their wives or mistresses to eunuch slaves, who were purchased at a very large price.] [Footnote 306: Daughters of Danaus.--Ver. 4. The portico under the temple of Apollo, on the Palatine Hill, was adorned with the statues of Danaus, the son of Belus, and his forty-nine guilty daughters. It was built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace. Ovid mentions these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1. 10.] [Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver. 20.

It was built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace. Ovid mentions these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1. 10.] [Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver. 20. 'Eat' seems here to mean 'let him go away' from the house; but Nisard's translation renders it 'qu'il entre,' 'let him come in.'] [Footnote 308: At the sacrifice.--Ver. 23. It is hard to say what 'si faciet tarde' means: it perhaps applies to the rites of Isis, mentioned in the 25th line.] If she shall be slow in her sacrifice.'] [Footnote 309: Linen-clad Isis.--Ver. 25. Seethe 74th line of the Eighth Elegy of the preceding Book, and the Note to the passage; and the Pontic Epistles, Book i. line 51, and the Note. The temple of Isis, at Rome, was in the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars, near the sheep market. It was noted for the intrigues and assignations of which it was the scene.] [Footnote 310: He turns the house.--Ver. 29. As the Delphin Editor says, 'Il peut renverser la maison,' 'he can turn the house upside down.'] [Footnote 311: The masters approve..--Ver. 30. He means to say that the eunuch and his mistress will be able to do just as they please.] [Footnote 312: An executioner.--Ver. 36. To blind the husband, by pretending harshness on the part of Bagous.] [Footnote 313: Of the truth.--Ver. 38 This line is corrupt, and there are about ten various readings. The meaning, however, is clear; he is, by making false charges, to lead the husband away from a suspicion of the truth; and to put him, as we say, in common parlance, on the wrong scent.] [Footnote 314: Your limited savings.--Ver. 39. 'Peculium,' here means the stock of money which a slave, with the consent of his master, laid up for his own, 'his savings.' The slaves of the Romans being not only employed in domestic offices and the labours of the field, but as agents or factors for their masters, in the management of business, and as mechanics and artisans in various trades, great profits were made through them. As they were often entrusted with a large amount of property, and considerable temptations were presented to their honesty, it became the practice to allow the slave to consider a part of his gains, perhaps a per centage, as his own; this was termed his 'peculium.' According to the strict letter of the law, the 'peculium' was the property of the master, but, by usage, it was looked upon as the property of the slave. It was sometimes agreed upon between the master and slave, that the latter should purchase his liberty with his 'peculium,' when it amounted to a certain sum. If the slave was manumitted by the owner in his lifetime, his 'peculium' was considered to be given him, with his liberty, unless it was expressly retained.] [Footnote 315: Necks of informers.--Ver. 41. He probably alludes to informers who have given false evidence. He warns Bagous of their fate, intending to imply that both his mistress and himself will deny all, if he should attempt to criminate them.] [Footnote 325: Tongue caused this.--Ver. 44. According to one account, his punishment was inflicted for revealing the secrets of the Gods.] [Footnote 326: Appointed by Juno.--Ver. 45. This was Argus, whose fate is related at the end of the First Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 327: Alas! that.--Ver. 1. He is again addressing Bagous, and begins in a strain of sympathy, since his last letter has proved of no avail with the obdurate eunuch.] [Footnote 328: Mutilate Joys --Ver. 3. According to most accounts, Semiramis was the first who put in practice this abominable custom.] [Footnote 329: Standard be borne.--Ver. 10. He means, that he is bound, with his mistress to follow the standard of Cupid, and not of Mars.] [Footnote 330: Favours to advantage.--Ver. 13. 'Ponere' here means, literally, 'to put out at interest.' He tells the eunuch that he has now the opportunity of conferring obligations, which will bring him in à good interest by way of return.] [Footnote 332: Sabine dames.--Ver. 15. Juvenal, in his Tenth Satire, 1. 293, mentions the Sabine women as examples of prudence and chastity.] [Footnote 333: In her stateliness.--Ver. 16. Burmann would have 'ex alto' to mean 'ex alto pectore,' 'from the depths of her breast.' In such case the phrase will correspond with our expression, 'to dissemble deeply,' 'to be a deep dissembler.'] [Footnote 334: Modulates her voice.--Ver. 25. Perhaps 'flectere vocem' means what we technically call, in the musical art, 'to quaver.'] [Footnote 335: Her arms to time.--Ver. 29.

Perhaps 'flectere vocem' means what we technically call, in the musical art, 'to quaver.'] [Footnote 335: Her arms to time.--Ver. 29. Dancing was, in general, discouraged among the Romans. That here referred to was probably the pantomimic dance, in which, while all parts of the body were called into action, the gestures of the arms and hands were especially used, whence the expressions 'manus loquacissimi,' 'digiti clamosi,' 'expressive hands,' or 'fingers.' During the Republic, and the earlier periods of the Empire, women never appeared on the stage, but they frequently acted at the parties of the great. As it was deemed disgraceful for a free man to dance, the practice at Rome was probably confined to slaves, and the lowest class of the citizens. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 536, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 336: Hippolytus.--Ver. 32. Hippolytus was an example of chastity, while Priapus was the very ideal of lustfulness.] [Footnote 337: Heroines of old.--Ver. 33. He supposes the women of the Heroic ages to have been of extremely tall stature. Andromache was remarkable for her height.] [Footnote 338: The brunette.--Ver. 39. 'Flava,' when coupled with a female name, generally signifies 'having the hair of a flaxen,' or 'golden colour'; here, however, it seems to allude to the complexion, though it would be difficult to say what tint is meant. Perhaps an American would have no difficulty in translating it 'a yellow girl.' In the 43rd line, he makes reference to the hair of a 'flaxen,' or 'golden colour.'] [Footnote 339: Tablets rubbed out.--Ver. 5. If 'deletæ' is the correct reading here, it must mean 'no tablets from which in a hurry you 'have rubbed off the writing.' 'Non interceptæ' has been suggested, and it would certainly better suit the sense. 'No intercepted tablets have, &c.'] [Footnote 342: The wine on table.--Ver. 14. The wine was probably on this occasion placed on the table, after the 'coena,' or dinner. The Poet, his mistress, and his acquaintance, were, probably, reclining on their respective couches; he probably, pretended to fall asleep to watch, their conduct, which may have previously excited his suspicions.] [Footnote 343: Moving your eyebrows.--Ver. 15. See the Note to the 19th line of the Fourth Elegy of the preceding Book.] [Footnote 344: Were not silent.--Ver. 17. See the Note to the 20th line of the same Elegy.] [Footnote 345: Traced over with wine.--Ver. 18. See the 22nd and 26th lines of the same Elegy.] [Footnote 346: Your discourse.--Ver. 19. He seems to mean that they were pretending to be talking on a different subject from that about which they were really discoursing, but that he understood their hidden meaning. See a similar instance mentioned in the Epistle of Paris to Helen, 1. 241.] [Footnote 347: Hand of a master.--Ver. 30. He asserts the same right over her favours, that the master (dominus) does over the services of the slave.] [Footnote 348: New-made husband.--Ter. 36. Perhaps this refers to the moment of taking off the bridal veil, or 'flammeum,' when she has entered her husband's house.] [Footnote 349: Of her steeds.--Ver. 38. When the moon appeared red, probably through a fog, it was supposed that she was being subjected to the spells of witches and enchanters.] [Footnote 350: Assyrian ivory.--Ver. 40. As Assyria adjoined India, the word 'Assyrium' is here used by poetical licence, as really meaning 'Indian.'] [Footnote 351: Woman has stained.--Ver. 40. From this we learn that it was the custom of the Lydians to tint ivory of a pink colour, that it might not turn yellow with age.] [Footnote 352: Of this quality.--Ver. 54. 'Nota,' here mentioned, is literally the mark which was put upon the 'amphorae,' or 'cadi,' the 'casks' of the ancients, to denote the kind, age, or quality of the wine. Hence the word figuratively means, as in the present instance, 'sort,' or 'quality.' Our word 'brand' has a similar meaning. The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the 'dolia,' or large vessels, in which they were kept into the 'amphoræ,' which were made of earthenware or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum. On the outside, the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage being denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the vessels were of glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f1cbc70bf76a9f17da10b1c67a4da593", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ",' which were made of earthenware or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum. On the outside, the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage being denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the vessels were of glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were suspended from them, stating to a similar effect. For a full account of the ancient wines, see Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities.] [Footnote 353: The imitative bird.--Ver. 1. Statius, in his Second Book, calls the parrot 'Humanæ sollers imitator linguæ,' 'the clever imitator of the human voice.'] [Footnote 354: The long trumpet.--Ver. 6. We learn from Aulus Gellius, that the trumpeters at funerals were called 'siticines.' They headed the funeral procession, playing mournful strains on the long trumpet, 'tuba,' here mentioned. These were probably in addition to the 'tibicines,' or 'pipers,' whose number was limited to ten by Appius Claudius, the Censor. See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 653.] [Footnote 360: Affectionate turtle-dove.--Ver. 12. This turtle-dove and the parrot had been brought up in the same cage together. He probably refers to these birds in the thirty-eighth line of the Epistle of Sappho to Phaon where he mentions the turtle-dove as being black. This Elegy is remarkable for its simplicity and pathetic beauty, and can hardly fail to remind the reader of Cowper's Elegies, on the death of the bullfinch, and that of his pet hare.] [Footnote 361: The Phocian youth.--Ver. 15. He alludes to the friendship of Orestes and Pylades the Phocian, the son of Strophius.] [Footnote 362: So prettily.--Ver. 24. 'Bene' means here, 'prettily,' or 'cleverly,' rather than 'distinctly,' which would be inconsistent with the signification of blæsus.] [Footnote 363: All their battles --Ver. 27. Aristotle, in the Eighth Chapter of the Ninth Book of his History of Animals, describes quails or ortolans, and partridges, as being of quarrelsome habits, and much at war among themselves.] [Footnote 364: The foreboder.--Ver. 34. Festus Avienus, in his Prognostics, mentions the jackdaw as foreboding rain by its chattering.] [Footnote 366: Armed Minerva.--Ver. 35. See the story of the Nymph Coronis, in the Second Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 367: After nine ages.--Ver. 36. Pliny makes the life of the crow to last for a period of three hundred years.] [Footnote 368: Destined numbers.--Ver. 40. 'Numeri' means here, the similar. parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'] [Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver. 45. Hippocrates, in his Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the critical days in a malady. Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the person so doing.] [Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver. 48. It may have said 'Corinna;' but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,' 'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.] [Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver. 49. He kindly imagines a place for the souls of the birds that are blessed.] [Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver. 58. His calling around him, in human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and beautifully imagined.] [Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver. 61. This and the following line are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.] [Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver. 1. 'Ergo' here is very expressive. 'Am I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'] [Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver. 15. Perhaps the only holiday that the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June, when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had rendered an important service. See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 311, et seq.] [Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver. 17. She was the 'ornatrix,' or 'tiring woman' of Corinna. As slaves very often received their names from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate character, and extended downwards to the ancles.] [Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver. 22", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9ba3706ec176b6f1bdc3b92e3affac80", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ", et seq.] [Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver. 17.

From this we see that the whip was applied to the female slaves, as well as the males.] [Footnote 388: Carpathian ocean..--Ver. 20. See the Metamorphoses, Book xi.] 1. 249, and the Note to this passage.] [Footnote 389: Swarthy Cypassis.--Ver. 22. From this expression, she was probably a native of Egypt or Syria.] [Footnote 390: With his spear.--Ver. 7. He alludes to the cure of Telephus by the aid of the spear of Achilles, which had previously wounded him.] [Footnote 391: Cottages of thatch.--Ver. 18. In the First Book of the Fasti, 1.199, he speaks of the time when 'a little cottage received Quiriuus, the begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded him a scanty couch.' The straw-thatched cottage of Romulus was preserved at Rome for many centuries. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 184, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 392: Off to the fields.--Ver. 19. The 'emeriti,' or veterans of the Roman legions, who had served their full time, received a regular discharge, which was called 'missio,' together with a bounty, either in money, or an allotment of land. Virgil was deprived of his property near Mantua, by the officers of Augustus; and in his first Eclogue, under the name of Tityrus, he relates how he obtained restitution of it on applying to the Emperor.] [Footnote 393: Free from the race.--Ver. 20. Literally, 'the starting place.'] [Footnote 394: Wand of repose--Ver. 22. For an account of the 'rudis,' and the privilege it conferred, see the Tristia, Book, iv, El. 8. 1. 24.] [Footnote 395: Græcinus.--Ver. 1. He addresses three of his Pontic Epistles, namely, the Sixth of the First Book, the Sixth of the Second Book, and the Ninth of the Fourth Book, to his friend Græcinus. In the latter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.] [Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver. 3. 'Inermis,' may be rendered, 'off my guard.'] [Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver. 10. 'Pliaselos' is perhaps here used as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was particularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its name from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.' The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various sizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage. Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant vessels. Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness than for their strength. Juvenal, Sat. xv, 1. 127, speaks of them as being made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of the smallest kind.] [Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23. The Poet was of slender figure.] [Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver. 31. He alludes to the 'lorica,' or cuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.] [Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver. 36. He probably was thinking at this moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T. Haterius, of the Equcstriai order, whose singular end is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, 11. ix c. 12, s. 8, and by Pliny the Elder, B. vii., c. 53.] [Footnote 404: The meeting rocks.--Ver 3. See the 121st line of the Epistle of Medea to Jason, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 405: Tinted pebbles.--Ver. 13. The 'picti lapilli' are probably camelians, which are found on the sea shore, and are of various tints.] [Footnote 406: The recreation.--Ver. 14. 'Mora,' 'delay,' is put here for that which causes the delay. 'That is a pleasure which belongs to the shore.'] [Footnote 407: In what Malea.--Ver. 20.

Some think that it refers to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line of his Third Ode, B. i., 'Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,' 'The brothers of Helen, those brilliant stars.' Others think that it refers to the luminous appearances which were seen to settle on the masts of ships, and were called by the name of Castor and Pollux; they were thought to be of good omen when both appeared, but unlucky when seen singly.] [Footnote 410: In the couch.--Ver. 31. 'Torus' most probably means, in this place a sofa, on which the ladies would recline while reading.] [Footnote 411: Amusing books.--Ver. 31. By using the diminutive 'libellus' here, he probably means some light work, such as a bit of court scandal, of a love poem.] [Footnote 412: My Divinities.--Ver. 44.

El. 10.] [Footnote 416: And the cause.--Ver. 17. This passage is evidently misunderstood in Nisard's translation, 'Je ne serai pas non plus la caus d'une nouvelle guerre,' 'I will never more be the cause of a new war.'] [Footnote 417: A female again.--Ver. 22. He alludes to the war in Latium, between Æneas and Turnus, for the hand of Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus and Amata. See the narrative in the Fourteenth book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 421: 'Twas the females--Ver. 23. The rape of the Sabines, by the contrivance of Romulus, is here alluded to. The narrative will be found in the Third Book of the Fasti, 1. 203, et seq. It has been suggested, but apparently without any good grounds, that Tarpeia is here alluded to.] [Footnote 422: Thou who dost.--Ver. 7. Io was said to be worshipped under the name of Isis.] [Footnote 423: Parætonium.--Ver. 7. This city was situate at the Canopic mouth of the Nile, at the Western extremity of Egypt, adjoining to Libya. According to Strabo, its former name was Ammonia. It still preserves its ancient name in a great degree, as it is called al-Baretoun.] [Footnote 424: Fields of Canopus.--Ver. 7. Canopus was a city at one of the mouths of the Nile, now called Aboukir. The epithet 'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it was famous for its voluptuousness. Strabo tells us that there was a temple there dedicated to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from Alexandria. He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and women dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest licentiousness. The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and was about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria. Ovid gives a similar description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El. ii. 1. 79. See the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 425: Memphis.--Ver. 8. Memphis was a city situate on the North of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile. It was said to have been built by Osirit.] [Footnote 426: Pharos.--Ver. 8.

See the Metamorphoses, Book ix. 1. 692, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 431: The sluggish serpent.--Ver. 13. Macrobius tells us, that the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right, of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the right hand of the statue of the Deity. To this the Poet possibly alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and perhaps, was looked upon as sacred. If so, it is probable that the word 'pigra,' 'sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting of the asp, which was generally mortal. This, indeed, seems the more likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 93; which see, with the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver. 14. See the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 691, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 433: Thy features.--Ver. 15. Isis is here addressed, as being supposed to be the same Deity as Diana Lucina, who was invoked by pregnant and parturient women. Thus Isis appears to Telethusa, a Cretan woman, in her pregnancy, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 665, et seq.] [Footnote 434: Thy appointed days.--Ver. 17. Votaries who were worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice. In the First Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. i. 1. 50, Ovid says, 'I have beheld one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis, clothed in linen, sitting before he altars of Isis.'] [Footnote 435: On which.--Ver. 18. 'Queis' seems a preferable reading to 'qua.'] [Footnote 436: The Galli.--Ver. 18. Some suppose that Isis and Cybele were the same Divinity, and that the Galli, or priests of Cybele, attended the rites of their Goddess under the name of Isis. It seems clear, from the present passage, that the priests of Cybele, who were called Galli, did perform the rites of Isis, but there is abundant proof that these were considered as distinct Deities. In imitation of the Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele, they performed her rites to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and ran to and fro in a frenzied manner.] [Footnote 437: With thy laurels.--Ver. 18. See the Note to the 692nd line of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses. While celebrating the search for the limbs of Osiris, the priests uttered lamentations, accompanied with the sound of the 'sistra'; but when they had found the body, they wore wreaths of laurel, and uttered cries, signifying their joy.] [Footnote 438: Ilithyia.--Ver. 21. As to the Goddess Ilithyia, see the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 283, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 439: With their bucklers.--Ver. 2. Armed with 'peltæ,' or bucklers, like the Amazons.] [Footnote 440: The sand must.--Ver. 8. This figure is derived from the gladiatorial fights of the amphitheatre, where the spot on which they fought was strewed with sand, both for the purpose of giving a firm footing to the gladiators, and of soaking up the blood that was shed.] [Footnote 441: Again throw stones.--Ver. 12. He alludes to Deucalion and Pyr-rha. See the First Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 442: Ilia had destroyed.--Ver. 16. Romulus was her son. See her story, related at the beginning of the Third Book of the Fasti.] [Footnote 443: Why pierce.--Ver. 27. He alludes to the sharp instruments which she had used for the purpose of procuring abortion: a practice which Canace tells Macareus that her nurse had resorted to. Epistle xi. 1. 40--43.] [Footnote 444: Armenian dens.--Ver. 35. See the Metamorphoses, Book viii. 1. 126, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 445: Many a time.--Ver. 38. He seems here to speak of this practice as being frequently resorted to.] [Footnote 446: She deserved it.--Ver. 40. From this, it would seem that the practice was considered censurable; but, perhaps it was one of those cases whose heinousness is never fully discovered till it has brought about its own punishment.] [Footnote 447: O ring.--Ver. 1.

'Rarus ager' means, a 'thin' or 'loose' soil, which was well suited for the cultivation of the grape.] [Footnote 464: That bears its berries.--Ver. 8. In Nisard's translation, the words 'bacciferam Pallada,' which mean the olive, are rendered 'L'amande Caere Pallas,' 'the almond dear to Pallas.'] [Footnote 465: Lengthened tracks.--Ver. 16. To the Delphin Editor this seems a silly expression.] [Footnote 466: The stormy Alps.--Ver. 19. See the Metamorphoses, Book ii. 1. 226, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 467: The obedient stream.--Ver. 35. This was a method of irrigation in agriculture, much resorted to by the ancients.] [Footnote 468: Fierce Cilicians --Ver. 39. The people of the interior of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, were of rude and savage manners while those on the coast had been engaged in piracy, until it had been effectually suppressed by Pompey.] [Footnote 469: Britons painted green.--Ver. 39. The Britons may be called 'virides,' from their island being surrounded by the sea; or, more probably, from the colour with which they were in the habit of staining their bodies. Cæsar says, in the Fifth Book of the Gallic war, 'The Britons stain themselves with woad, 'vitrum,' or 'glastum,' which produces a blue colour: and thus they become of a more dreadful appearance in battle.' The conquest of Britain, by Cæsar, is alluded to in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 752.] [Footnote 471: Loves the vine.--Ver. 41. The custom of training vines by the side of the elm, has been alluded to in a previous Note. See also the Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 663, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 472: As the nags.--Ver. 49. The 'manni' were used by the Romans for much the same purpose as our coach-horses; and were probably more noted for their fleetness than their strength; They were a small breed, originally imported from Gaul, and the possession of them was supposed to indicate the possession of considerable wealth. As the 'esseda' was a small vehicle, and probably of light structure, we must not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of driving for herself. The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety miles: and the journey, from his expressions in the fifty-first and fifty-second lines, must have been over hill and dale.] [Footnote 473: Your little chaise.--Ver. 49. For an account of the 'essedum,' or 'esseda,' see the Pontic Epistles, Book ii. Ep. 10, 1. 34, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 474: King of Pkthia.--Ver. 17.] He alludes to the marriage of Thetis, the sea Goddess, to Peleus, the king of Phthia, in Thessaly.] [Footnote 475: His anvil.--Ver. 19.

It is a somewhat curious fact, that the anvils of the ancients exactly resembled in form and every particular those used at the present day.] [Footnote 476: Becomingly united.--Ver. 22. He says, that in the Elegiac measure the Pentameter, or line of five feet, is not unhappily matched with the Hexameter, or heroic line of six feet.] [Footnote 477: Disavowed by you.--Ver. 26. 'Voids' seems more agreable to the sense of the passage, than 'nobis.' 'to be denied by us;' as, from the context, there was no fear of his declining her affection.] [Footnote 478: That she is Corinna.--Ver. 29. This clearly proves that Corinna was not a real name; it probably was not given by the Poet to any one of his female acquaintances in particular.] [Footnote 479: Thy poem onwards.--Ver. 1. Macer translated the Iliad of Homer into Latin verse, and composed an additional poem, commencing at the beginning of the Trojan war, and coming down to the wrath of Achilles, with which Homer begins.] [Footnote 480: I, Macer.--Ver. 3. Æmilius Macer is often mentioned by Ovid in his works. In the Tristia, Book iv. Ep. 10,1.41, he says, 'Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me his poem on birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb that is curative.' The Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic Epistles is also addressed to him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on the Trojan war, and the time when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily together. He speaks of him in the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as being then dead. Macer was a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend of Virgil, Ovid, and Tibullus. Some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history, was not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war; and, indeed, it does not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six years of age. The bard of Ilium died in Asia.] [Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver. 13. He alludes to his tragedy of Medea, which no longer exists. Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The Medea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had only preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'] [Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver. 27. He represents his friend, Sabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,' going with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and bringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra, Æneas to Dido, Demophoôn to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to Sappho. All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of Ulysses to Penelope, and Demophoôn to Phyllis. His Epistle from Paris to Oenonc, is not here mentioned. See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv. Ep. xvi. 1. 13, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver. 28. As the ancients had no establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special messengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.] [Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver. 34. Sappho says in her Epistle, that if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to Phobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock. This, he tells her, she may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.] [Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver. 11. She pretended a head-ache, when nothing wras the matter with her; in order that too much familiarity, in the end, might not breed contempt.] [Footnote 486: A surfeit of love.--Ver. 25. 'l'inguis amor' seems here to mear a satisfied 'ora 'pampered passion;' one that meets with no repulse.] [Footnote 487: Enclosed Danaë.--Ver. 27. See the Metamorphoses, Book iv., 1.] [Footnote 488: The dogs bark.--Ver. 40.

As Lydia was said to have sent colonists to Etruria, some Commentators think that the word 'Lydius' here means 'Etrurian and that the first actors at Rome were Etrurians. But, as the Romans derived their notions of tragedy from the Greeks, we may conclude that Lydia in Asia Minor is here referred to; for we learn from Herodotus and other historians, that the Greeks borrowed largely from the Lydians.] [Footnote 503: Drunken revels.--Ver. 17. He probably alludes to the Fourth Elegy of the First, and the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the 'Amores.'] [Footnote 505: Mighty inspiration.--Ver. 23. The 'thyrsus' was said to have been first used by the troops of Bacchus, in his Indian expedition, when, to deceive the Indians, they concealed the points of their spears amid leaves of the vine and ivy. Similar weapons were used by his devotees when worshipping him, which they brandished to and fro. To be touched with the thyrsus of Bacchus, meant 'to be inspired with poetic frenzy.' See the Notes to the Metamorphoses, Book iii. 1. 542.] [Footnote 506: In unequal numbers.--Ver. 37. Some have supposed, that allusion is made to the Tragedy of Medea, which Ovid had composed, and that it had been written in Elegiac measure. This, however, does not seem to be the meaning of the passage. Elegy justly asks Tragedy, why, if she has such a dislike to Elegiac verses, she has been talking in them? which she has done, from the 15th line to the 30th.] [Footnote 507: Myself the patroness.--Ver. 44. She certainly does not give herself a very high character in giving herself the title of 'lena.'] [Footnote 508: The fastened door.--Ver. 50. He alludes, probably, to one of the Elegies which he rejected, when he cut down the five books to three.] [Footnote 509: In a hose tunic.--Ver. 51. He may possibly allude to the Fifth Elegy of the First Book, as the words 'tunicâ velata recinctâ,' as applied to Corinna, are there found. But there he mentions midday as the time when Corinna came to him, whereas he seems here to allude to the middle of the night.] [Footnote 510: Cut in the wood.--Ver. 53. He alludes to the custom of lovers carving inscriptions on the doors of their obdurate mistresses: this we learn from Plautus to have been done in Elegiac strains, and sometimes with charcoal. 'Implentur meæ fores clegiarum carbonibus.' 'My doors are filled with the coal-black marks of elegies.'] [Footnote 511: On her birthday.--Ver. 57. She is telling Ovid what she has put up with for his sake; and she reminds him how, when he sent to his mistress some complimentary lines on her birthday, she tore them up and threw them in the water. Horace mentions 'the flames, or the Adriatic sea,' as the end of verses that displeased. Athenseus, Book xiii. c. 5, relates a somewhat similai story. Diphilus the poet was in the habit of sending his verses to his mistress Gnathæna. One day she was mixing him a cup of wine and snow-water, on which he observed, how cold her well must be; to which she answered, yes, for it was there that she used to throw his compositions.] [Footnote 514: From behind.--Ver. 70. It is not known, for certain, to what he refers in this line. Some think that he refers to the succeeding Elegies in this Book, which are, in general, longer than the former ones, while others suppose that he refers to his Metamorphoses, which he then contemplated writing. Burmann, however, is not satisfied with this explanation, and thinks that, in his more mature years, he contemplated the composition of Tragedy, after having devoted his youth to lighter snbjects; and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the composition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.] [Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver. 1. He is here alluding to the Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or greatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year. Some account is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1. 392. of the Second Book of the Fasti. The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the Fourth of the Ides of April. The buildings of the Circus were burnt in the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former magnificence, and made it capable", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-eb4eb8f1e4cf05e01dcfb95969a6bb79", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": ". Some account is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1. 392. of the Second Book of the Fasti. The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the Fourth of the Ides of April. The buildings of the Circus were burnt in the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former magnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of accommodating 385,000 persons. The Poet says, that he takes no particular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may win which is her favourite.] [Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver. 2. The usual number of chariots in each race was four. The charioteers were divided into four companies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing the season of the year. These colours were green for the spring, red for the summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter. Originally, but two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number to six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the purple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four. The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in the race. Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and colours; the names also of the charioteers were given, and bets were extensively made, (see the Art of Love, Book i. 1. 167, 168,) and sometimes disputes and violent contests arose.] [Footnote 517: To be seated by you.--Ver. 3. The men and women sat together when viewing the contests of the Circus, and not in separate parts of the building, as at the theatres.] [Footnote 518: Happy the driver.--Ver. 7. He addresses the charioteer.] [Footnote 519: The sacred barrier.--Ver. 9. For an account of the 'career,' or 'starting-place,' see the Notes to the Tristia, Book v. El. ix. 1. 29. It is called 'sacer,' because the whole of the Circus Maximus was sacred to Consus, who is supposed by some to have been the same Deity as Neptune. The games commenced with sacrifices to the Deities.] [Footnote 520: I would give rein.--Ver. 11. The charioteer was wont to stand within the reins, having them thrown round his back. Leaning backwards, he thereby threw his full weight against the horses, when he wished to check them at full speed. This practice, however, was dangerous, and by it the death of Hippolytus was caused. In the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses,1. 524, he says, 'I struggled, with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and throwing myself \"backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.' To avoid the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked knife at his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.] [Footnote 521: The turning-place.--Ver. 12. For an account of the 'meta.'see the Tristia, Book iv. El. viii.l. 35. Of course, thpse who kept as close to the 'meta' as possible, would lose the least distance in turning round it.] [Footnote 522: How nearly was Pelops.--Ver. 15. In his race with Onomaüs, king of Pisa, in Arcadia, for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia, when Pelops conquered his adversary by bribing his charioteer, Myrtilus.] [Footnote 523: Of his mistress.--Ver. 17. He here seems to imply that it was Hippodamia who bribed Myrtilus.] [Footnote 524: Shrink away in vain.--Ver. 19. She shrinks from him, and seems to think that he is sitting too close, but he tells her that the 'linea' forces them to squeeze. This 'linea' is supposed to have been either cord, or a groove, drawn across the seats at regular intervals, so as to mark out room for a certain number of spectators between each two 'lineæ.'] [Footnote 525: Has this advantage.--Ver. 20. He congratulates himsdf on the construction of the place, so aptly giving him an excuse for sitting close to his mistress.] [Footnote 526: But do you --Ver. 21. He is pretending to be very anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not to squeeze so close against his mistress.] [Footnote 527: And you as well.--Ver. 23. As in the theatres, the seats, which were called 'gradas,' 'sedilia,' or 'subsellia,' were arranged round the course of the Circus, in ascending tiers; the lowest being, very probably, almost flush with the ground.

He is here showing off his politeness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress. Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their dresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.] [Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver. 29. Some suppose that the Arcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the name of Milanion. According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds the Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of Hippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses. See the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p. 375. From this and another passage of Ovid, we have reason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty of her ancles.] [Footnote 530: The fan may cause.--Ver. 38. Instead of the word 'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but as the first syllable is long, such a reading would occasion a violation of the laws of metre, and 'tabella' is probably correct. It has, however, the same meaning here as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a fan;' in fact, the 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with peacocks' feathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated pieces of cloth. These were generally waved by female slaves, who were called 'flabelliferæ'; or else by eunuchs or young boys. They were used to cool the atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep. We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it must have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman Circus. That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving away flies, was called 'muscarium.' The use of fans was not confined to females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had a slave to fan him during his sleep. The fan was also sometimes made of linen, extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a bird, joined back to back, and attached to a handle.] [Footnote 531: Now the procession.--Ver. 34 All this time they have been waiting for the ceremony to commence. The 'Pompa,' or procession, now opens the performance. In this all those who were about to exhibit in the race took a part. The statues of the Gods were borne on wooden platforms on the shoulders of men, or on wheels, according as they were light or heavy. The procession moved from the Capitol, through the Forum, to the Circus Maximus, and was also attended by the officers of state. Musicians and dancers preceded the statues of the Gods. See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 391, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 532: Victory borne.--Ver. 45. On the wooden platform, which was called 'ferculum,' or 'thensa,' according as it was small or large.] [Footnote 533: With expanded wings.--Ver. 45. Victory was always represented with expanded wings, on account of her inconstancy and volatility.] [Footnote 534: Salute Neptune.--Ver. 47. 'Plaudite Neptuno' is equivalent, in our common parlance, to 'Give a cheer for Neptune.' He is addressing the sailors who may be present: but he declines to have anything to do with the sea himself.] [Footnote 535: Arms I detest.--Ver. 49. Like his contemporary, Horace, Ovid was no lover of war.] [Footnote 536: Of the artisan.--Ver. 52. We learn from the Fasti, Book iii. 1.815, that Minerva was especially venerated as the patroness of handicrafts.] [Footnote 537: Let the boxers.--Ver. 54. Boxing was one of the earliest athletic games practised by the Greeks. Apollo and Hercules, as well as Pollux, are celebrated by the poets for excelling in this exercise. It formed a portion of the Olympic contests; while boys fought in the Nemean and Isthmian games. Concerning the 'cæstus' used by pugilists, see the Fasti, Book ii. 1. 367, and the Note to the passage. The method in fighting most practised was to remain on the defensive, and thus to wear out the opponent by continual efforts. To inflict blows, without receiving any in return on the body, was the great point of merit. The right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was to protect the body. Teeth were often knocked out, and the ears were much disfigured. The boxers, by the rules of the game, were not allowed to take hold of each other, nor to trip up their antagonist. In Italy boxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of Etruria.

In Italy boxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of Etruria. It continued to be one of the popular games during the period of the Republic as well as of the Empire.] [Footnote 538: In the lattice work.--Ver. 64. The 'cancelli' were lattice work, which probably fkirted the outer edge of each wide 'præcinctio,' or passage,that ran along in front of the seats, at certain intervals. As the knees would not there be so cramped, these seats would be considered the most desirable. It is clear that Ovid and the lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the feet resting either on the lowest 'præcinctio', or the 'præcinctio' of a set of seats higher up. Stools, of course, could not be used, as they would be in the way of passers-by. He perceives, as the seat is high, that she has some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and naturally concludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it will give her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work railing which was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper 'præcinctio,' ran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest tier, skirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that tier. This she might do, if the 'præcinctio' was not more than a yard wide, and if the 'cancelli' were as much as a foot in height.] [Footnote 539: Now the Prcetor.--Ver. 65. The course is now clear of the procession, and the Prætor gives the signal for the start, the 'carceres' being first opened. This was sometimes given by sound of trumpet, or more frequently by letting fall a napkin; at least, after the time of Nero, who is said, on one occasion, while taking a meal, to have heard the shouts of the people who were impatient for the race to begin, on which he threw down his napkin as the signal.] [Footnote 540: The even harriers.--Ver. 66. From this description we should be apt to think that the start was effected at the instant when the 'carceres' were opened. This was not the case: for after coming out of the-carceres,' the chariots were ranged abreast before a white line, which was held by men whose office it was to do, and who were called 'moratores.' When all were ready, and the signal had been given, the white line was thrown down, and the race commenced, which was seven times round the course. The 'career' is called 'æquum,' because they were in a straight line, and each chariot was ranged in front of the door of its 'career.'] [Footnote 541: Circuit far too wide.--Ver. 69. The charioteer, whom the lady favours, is going too wide of the 'meta,' or turning-place, and so loses ground, while the next overtakes him.] [Footnote 542: To the left.--Ver. 72. He tells him to guide the horses to the left, so as to keep closer to the 'meta,' and not to lose so much ground by going wide of it.] [Footnote 543: Call him back again.--Ver. 73. He, by accident, lets drop the observation, that they have been interesting themselves for a blockhead. But he immediately checks himself, and, anxious that the favourite may yet distinguish himself, trusts that the spectators will call him back. Crispinus, the Delphin Editor, thinks, that by the calling back, it is meant that it was a false start, and that the race was to be run over again. Bur-mann, however, is not of that opinion; but supposes, that if any chariot did not go well, or the horses seemed jaded, it was the custom to call the driver back from the present race, that with new horses he might join in the next race. This, from the sequel, seems the most rational mode of explanation here.] [Footnote 544: Waving the garments.--Ver. 74. The signal for stopping was given by the men rising and shaking and waving their outer garments, or 'togae,' and probably calling the charioteer by name.] [Footnote 545: Disarrange your hair.--Ver. 75. He is afraid lest her neighbours, in their vehemence should discommode her hair, and tells her, in joke, that she may creep into the bosom of his own 'toga.'] [Footnote 546: And now the barrier.--Ver. 77.

The first race we are to suppose finished, and the second begins similarly to the first. There were generally twenty-five of these 'missus,' or races in a day.] [Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver. 78. See the Note to the second line.] [Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver. 79. He addresses the favourite, who has again started in this race.] [Footnote 549: Bears away the palm.--Ver. 82. The favourite charioteer is now victorious, and the Poet hopes that he himself may gain the palm in like manner. The victor descended from his car at the end of the race, and ascended the 'spina,' where he received his reward, which was generally a considerable sum of money. For an account of the 'spina,' see the Metamorphoses, Book x. l. 106, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 550: Her beauty remains.--Ver. 2. She has not been punished with ugliness, as a judgment for her treachery.] [Footnote 551: Proved false to me.--Ver. 10. Tibullus has a similar passage, 'Et si perque suos fallax juravit ocellos 'and if with her eyes the deceitful damsel is forsworn.'] [Footnote 552: Its divine sway.--Ver. 12. 'Numen' here means a power equal to that of the Divinities, and which puts it on a level with them.] [Footnote 553: Mine felt pain.--Ver. 14. When the damsel swore by them, his eyes smarted, as though conscious of her perjury.] [Footnote 554: Forsooth to you.--Ver. 17. He says that surely it was enough for the Gods to punish Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, for the sins of her mother, without making him to suffer misery for the perjury of his mistress. Cassiope, the mother of Andromeda, having dared to compare her own beauty with that of the Nereids, her daughter was, by the command of Jupiter, exposed to a sea-monster, which was afterwards slain by Perseus. See the Metamorphoses, Book iv. 1. 670.] [Footnote 555: Hurls at the groves.--Ver. 35. A place which had been struck by lightning was called 'bidental,' and was held sacred ever afterwards. The same veneration was also paid to a place where any person who had been killed by lightning was buried. Priests collected the earth that had been torn up by lightning, and everything that had been scorched, and buried it in the ground with lamentations. The spot was then consecrated by sacrificing a two-year-old sheep, which being called 'bidens,' gave its name to the place. An altar was also erected there, and it was not allowable thenceforth to tread on the spot, or to touch it, or even look at it. When the altar had fallen to decay, it might be renovated, but to remove its boundaries was deemed sacrilege. Madness was supposed to ensue on committing such an offence; and Seneca mentions a belief, that wine which had been struck by lightning, would produce death or madness in those who drank it.] [Footnote 556: Unfortunate Semele.--Ver. 37. See the fate of Semele, related in the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 557: Have some regard.--Ver. 49. Or, in other words. 'Don't sweat any more by my eyes.'] [Footnote 558: Because she cannot, stilt sews.--Ver. 4. It is not a little singular that a heathen poet should enunciate the moral doctrine of the New Testament, that it is the thought, and not the action, that of necessity constitutes the sin.] [Footnote 559: A hundred in his neck.--Ver. 18. In the First Book of the Metamorphoses, he assigns to Argus only one hundred eyes; here, however, he uses a poet's license, prohably for the sake of filling up the line.] [Footnote 560: Its stone and its iron.--Ver. 21. From Pausanias and Lucian we learn that the chamber of Danaë was under ground, and was lined with copper and iron.] [Footnote 561: Nor yet is it legal.--Ver. 33. He tells him that he ought not to inflict loss of liberty on a free-born woman, a punishment that was only suited to a slave.] [Footnote 562: Those two qualities.--Ver. 42. He says, the wish being probably the father to the thought, that beauty and chastity cannot possibly exist together.] [Footnote 563: Many a thing at home.--Ver. 48. He tells him that he will grow quite rich with the presents which his wife will then receive from her admirers.] [Footnote 564: Its bubbling foam..--Ver. 13. He alludes to the noise which the milk makes at the moment when it touches that in the pail.] [Footnote 565: Ewe when milked.--Ver. 14. Probably the milk of ewes was used for making cheese, as is sometimes the case in this country.] [Footnote 566: Hag of a procuress.--Ver. 40.

Probably the milk of ewes was used for making cheese, as is sometimes the case in this country.] [Footnote 566: Hag of a procuress.--Ver. 40. We have been already introduced to one amiable specimen of this class in the Eighth Elegy of the First Book.] [Footnote 567: River that hast.--Ver. 1. Ciofanus has this interesting Note:--'This river is that which flows near the walls of Sulmo, and, which, at the present day we call 'Vella.' In the early spring, when the snows melt, and sometimes, at the beginning of autumn, it swells to a wonderful degree with the rains, so that it becomes quite impassable. Ovid lived not far from the Fountain of Love, at the foot of the Moronian hill, and had a house there, of which considerable vestiges still remain, and are called 'la botteghe d'Ovidio.' Wishing to go thence to the town of Sulmo, where his mistress was living, this river was an obstruction to his passage.'] [Footnote 568: A hollow boat.--Ver. 4. 'Cymba' was a name given to small boats used on rivers or lakes. He here alludes to a ferry-boat, which was not rowed over; but a chain or rope extending from one side of the stream to the other, the boatman passed across by running his hands along the rope.] [Footnote 569: The opposite mountain.--Ver. 7. The mountain of Soracte was near the Flaminian way, in the territory of the Falisci, and may possibly be the one here alluded to. Ciofanus says that its name is now 'Majella,-and that it is equal in height to the loftiest mountains of Italy, and capped with eternal snow. All one with the day.--Ver. 10. He means to say that he has risen early in the morning for the purpose of proceeding on his journey.] [Footnote 570: The son of Danaë.--Ver. 13. Mercury was said to have lent to Perseus his winged shoes, 'talaria,' when he slew Medusa with her viperous locks.] [Footnote 571: Wish for the chariot.--Ver. 15. Ceres was said to have sent Trip-tolemus in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, to introduce agriculture among mankind. See the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1. 558.] [Footnote 572: Inachus.--Ver. 25. Inachus was a river of Argolis, in Peloponnesus.] [Footnote 573: Love for Melie.--Ver. 25. Melie was a Nymph beloved by Neptune, to whom she bore Amycus, king of Bebrycia, or Bithynia, in Asia Minor, whence her present appellation.] [Footnote 574: Alpheus.--Ver 29. See the story of Alpheus and Arethusa, in the Fifth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 576.] [Footnote 575: Creüsa.--Ver. 31. Creüsa was a Naïad, the mother of Hypseas, king of the Lapithae, by Peneus, a river of Thessaly. Xanthus was a rivulet near Troy. Of Creüsa being promised to Xanthus nothing whatever is known.] [Footnote 576: The be beloved by Mars.--Ver. 33. Pindar, in his Sixth Olympic Ode, says that Metope, the daughter of Ladon, was the mother of live daughters, by Asopus, a river of Boeotia. Their names were Corcyra, Ægina, Salamis, Thebe, and Harpinna. Ovid, in calling her Thebe, probably follows some other writer. She is called 'Martia,' because she was beloved by Mars, to whom she bore Evadne.] [Footnote 577: Hand of Hercules.--Ver. 36. For the contest of Hercules and Achelous for the hand of Deianira, see the beginning of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 578: Calydon.--Ver. 37. Aeneus, the father of Meleager and Dei'anira, reigned over Ætolia, of which Calydon was the chief city.] [Footnote 579: The native spot.--Ver. 40; He alludes to the fact of the source or native country of the Nile being then, as it probably still is, quite unknown.] [Footnote 580: Daughter of Asopus.--Ver. 41. Evadne is called 'Asopide,' from her mother being the wife of Asopus. See the Note on line 33 above.] [Footnote 581: Enipeus dried up.--Ver. 43. Probably the true reading here is 'fictus,' 'the false Enipeus.' Tyro was the daughter of Salmoneus, king of Pisa, in Elis. She being much enamoured of the river Enipeus, Neptune is said to have assumed his form, and to have been, by her, the father of Pelias and Neleus.'] [Footnote 582: Argive Tibur,--Ver. 46.

Tibur was a town beautifully situate in the neighbourhood of Home; it was said to have been founded by three Argive brothers, Tyburtus, Catillus, and Coras.] [Footnote 583: Whom Ilia.--Ver. 47. Ilia was said to have been buried alive, by the orders of Amulius, on the banks of the river Tiber; or, according to some, to have been thrown into that river, on which she is said to have become the wife of the river, and was deified. Acron, an ancient historian, wrote to the effect that her ashes were interred on the banks of the Anio; and that river overflowing, carried them to the bed of the Tiber, whence arose the story of her nuptials with the latter. According to one account, she was not put to death, but was imprisoned, having been spared by Amulius at the entreaty of his daughter, who was of the same age as herself, and at length regained her liberty.] [Footnote 584: Descendant of Laomedon.--Ver. 54. She was supposed to be descended from Laomedon, through Ascanius, the son of Creüsa, the granddaughter of Laomedon.] [Footnote 585: No white fillet.--Ver. 56. The fillet with which the Vestals bound their hair.] [Footnote 586: Am I courted.--Ver. 75. The Vestais were released from their duties, and were allowed to marry if they chose, after they had served for thirty years. The first ten years were passed in learning their duties, the next ten in performing them, and the last ten in instructing the novices.] [Footnote 587: Did she throw herself.--Ver. 80. The Poet follows the account which represented her as drowning herself.] [Footnote 588: To some fixed rule.--Ver. 89. 'Legitimum' means 'according to fixed laws so that it might be depended upon, 'in a steady manner.'] [Footnote 589: Injurious to the flocks.--Ver. 99. It would be 'damnosus' in many ways, especially from its sweeping away the cattle and the produce of the land. Its waters, too, being turbid, would be unpalatable to the thirsty traveller, and unwholesome from the melted snow, which would be likely to produce goitre, or swellings in the throat.] [Footnote 590: Could I speak of the rivers.--Ver. 103. He apologizes to the Acheloüs, Inachus, and Nile, for presuming to mention their names, in addressing such a turbid, contemptible stream.] [Footnote 591: After my poems.--Ver. 5. He refers to his lighter works; such, perhaps, as the previous books of his Amores. This explains the nature of the 'libelli,' which he refers to in his address to his mistress, in the Second Book of the Amores, El. xi. 1. 31.] [Footnote 592: His wealth acquired.--Ver. 9. 'Censu.' For the explanation of this word, see the Fasti, B. i. 1. 217, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 593: Through his wounds.--Ver. 9. In battle, either by giving wounds, or receiving them.] [Footnote 594: Which thus late.--Ver. 15. By 4 serum,'he means that his position, as a man of respectable station, has only been recently acquired, and has not descended to him through a long line of ancestors.] [Footnote 595: Was it acquired.--Ver. 20. This was really much to the merit of his rival; but most of the higher classes of the Romans affected to despise anything like gain by means of bodily exertion; and the Poet has extended this feeling even to the rewards of merit as a soldier.] [Footnote 596: Hold sway over.--Ver. 27. He here plays upon the two meanings of the word 'deducere.' 'Deducere carmen' is 'to compose poetry'; 'deducere primum pilum' means 'to form' or 'command the first troop of the Triarii.' These were the veteran soldiers of the Roman army, and the 'Primipilus' (which office is here alluded to) being the first Centurion of the first maniple of them, was the chief Centurion of the legion, holding an office somewhat similar to our senior captains. Under the Empire this office was very lucrative. See the Note to the 49th line of the Seventh Epistle, in the-Fourth Book of the Pontic Epistles.] [Footnote 597: The ravished damsel.--Ver. 30. He alludes to Danaë.] [Footnote 598: Resorted to presents.--Ver. 33. He seems to allude to the real meaning of the story of Danaë, which, no doubt, had reference to the corrupting influence of money.] [Footnote 599: With no boundaries.--Ver. 42. The 'limes' was a line or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones.

The 'limes' was a line or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones. The 'ager limitatus' was the public land marked out by 'limites,' for the purposes of allotment to the citizens. On apportioning the land, a line, which was called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East to West, which was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from North to South. The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn depended on the magnitude of the squares or 'centuriæ,' as they were called, into which it was purposed to divide the tract.] [Footnote 601: Then was the shore.--Ver. 44. Because they had not as yet learnt the art of navigation.] [Footnote 602: Turreted fortifications.--Ver. 47. Among the ancients the fortifications of cities were strengthened by towers, which were placed at intervals on the walls; they were also generally used at the gates of towns.] [Footnote 603: Why not seek the heavens.--Ver. 50. With what indignation would he not have spoken of a balloon, as being nothing less than a downright attempt to scale the 'tertia régna!'] [Footnote 604: Ciesar but recently.--Ver. 52. See the end of the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, and the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 704.] [Footnote 605: The Senate-house.--Ver. 55. 'Curia'was the name of the place where the Senate held its meetings, such as the 'curia Hostilia,' Julia,' Marcelli,' and others. Hence arose the custom of calling the Senate itself, in the various Roman towns, by the name of 'curia,' but not the Senate of Rome. He here means to say, that poverty excluded a man from the Senate-house, and that wealth alone was the qualification for the honours of the state.] [Footnote 606: Wealth alone confers honours --Ver. 55. The same expression occurs in the Fasti, Book i. 1. '217, where a similar complaint is made on the worldly-mindedness of the age.] [Footnote 607: The Field of Mars.--Ver. 57. The 'comitia,' or meetings for the elections of the magistrates, were held on the 'Campus Martius' or field of Mars. See the Notes to the Fasti, Book i. 1. 53.] [Footnote 608: And the Forum. --Ver. 57. The 'Fora' were of two kinds at Rome; some being market-places, where all kinds of goods were exposed for sale, while others were solely courts of justice. Among the latter is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after that period, as in the present instance. At a later period of the Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets 'vetus,' 'old,' or 'magnum, 'great.' It was situate between the Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh, which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius. It was chiefly used for judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.' Gladiatorial games were occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless legionary soldiers, were there put to death. A second 'Forum,' for judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his name. It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix. A third was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men of the republic. Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was restored by the Emperor Hadrian. It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. xv. 1. 16. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 704.] [Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver. 63. He says that because he is poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband and those whom he has set to watch her.] [Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver. 5. Burmann remarks, that the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods; literally 'the priest of thy rites.'] [Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver. 6. Among the Romans the corpse was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.' According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed by the Latin writers.] It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the deceased. On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands, were thrown upon it.", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1c9d540a7609b6ba4c69dd1651e5329e", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "was called by the former name before, and hy the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed by the Latin writers.] It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the deceased. On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands, were thrown upon it. Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were sometimes used for the same purpose. This was done not only by the family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral procession.] [Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver. 16. He alludes to the death of Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh. See the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses, l. 716.] [Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver. 17. In the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 6, he says. 'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the impregnating. particles of the mind of the Divinity.'] [Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver. 20. It must be remembered that, whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans represented the grim tyrant as being a female. It is a curious fact that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman monuments. The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii. The head of a horse was one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified departure.] [Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver. 21. Apollo and the Muse Calliope were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death. See the beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 616: Linus! Alas!--Ver. 23. 'Ælinon' was said to have been the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus. The word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas! Linus.' A certain poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus, that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects. There appear to have been two persons of the name of Linus. One was a Theban, the son of Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.] [Footnote 617: The son of Mæon. --Ver. 25. See the Note to the ninth line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.] [Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver. 30. The web of Penelope.] [Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver. 31. Nemesis and Delia were the names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.] [Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver. 33. He alludes to two lines in the] First Elegy of Tibullus.] 'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia? quid mihi prosunt] Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.'] What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis? what avail me those sistra so often shaken by your hand?'] [Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver. 34. During the festival of Isis, all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.] [Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver. 38. The place where a person was burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot, and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place. See the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii. 1. 531.] [Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver. 45. He alludes to Venus, who had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.] [Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver. 47. The Phæacians were the ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu. Tibullus had attended Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among the Phæacians. To this Elegy Ovid here refers. Tibullus afterwards recovered, and died at Rome. When he penned this line, Ovid little thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of civilization.] [Footnote 625: Here.--Ver. 49. 1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.] [Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver. 49. He alludes to the custom of the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.] [Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver. 50. The perfumes and other offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to.

He alludes to the custom of the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.] [Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver. 50. The perfumes and other offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to. Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--] 'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,] Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis'] 'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes, and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.' To this passage Ovid makes reference in the next two lines.] [Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver. 53. 'Prior;' his former love was Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis. They are both represented here as attending his obsequies. Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of the First Book, addressing Delia:--] 1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,] Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.] Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,] Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.'] May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you with my failing hand. Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears of grief.' To these lines Ovid evidently here refers. It would appear from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss when the body was laid on the funeral pile.] [Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver. 58. Nemesis here alludes to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.] [Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver. 62. Catullus was a Roman poet, a native of Verona. Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit. The poems of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and Demetrius, who were famous composers. See the Tristia, Book ii. lines 427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.] [Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver. 64. He alludes to the fact of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 446, that the fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when he was in a state o inebriety. Some writers say, that when Governor of Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids, and that this constituted his crime. Others again, suppose that he was guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people of Thebea with his exactions. Some of the Commentators think that under the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known to have existed. Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.] [Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver. 1. This festival of Ceres occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that month. See the Fasti, Book iv. 1. 393. White garments, were worn at this festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited. The worship was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.] [Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver. 9. On the oaks, the oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253 and 467.] [Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver. 20. See an account of the education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of the Fasti, L 499, et seq.] [Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver. 25. Iasius, or Iasion, was, according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus. According to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph Phronia. According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres. He was also said by some to be the husband of Cybele. He is supposed to have been a successful husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.

Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 300. See the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver. 30. With less corn than had been originally sown.] [Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver. 41. Minos is said to have been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.] [Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver. 6. This figure is derived from the horns, the weapons of the bull. 'At length I have assumed the weapons of defence.' It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.' 'Too late, alas! I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!] [Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver. 7. He addresses himself, recommending fortitude as his only cure.] [Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver. 10. At the door of his mistress; a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman lovers.] [Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver. 15. As, of courser, his rival would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.] [Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver. 17. By the use of the word 'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.] [Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver. 22. This forms the subject of the Third Elegy of the present Book.] [Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver. 23. See the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the Amores.] [Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver. 26. When he arrived, he found his rival in her company.] [Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver. 35. This and the next line are considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.] [Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver. 5. Commentators are at a loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book, when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses. If Corinna was anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.] [Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver. 9. He says that, unconsciously, he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending his mistress to the public. The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered for sale. These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the 'magister auctionum.' The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals, to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry them and search for them. The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.] [Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver. 15. He speaks of the Theban war, the Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time in singing in praise of Corinna. This, however, may be said in reproof of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that Corinna is the cause of his present complaint. The Roman poet Statius afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.] [Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver. 19. That is, 'to rely implicitly on the testimony of poets.' The word 'poetas' requires a semicolon after it, and not a comma.] [Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver. 21. He here falls into his usual mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus. See the Note to 1. 33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth Books of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver. 24. In the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster, by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used the services", "full_doc_id": "doc-45bcc00eaae8e324b11570698e892562", "file_path": "unknown_source", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c2ae1d708e454e0e6bf3e72d6ca49fad", "__created_at__": 1758349909, "content": "in the affections of Glaucus.

In the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster, by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion. It has been suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.] [Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver. 25. Tityus was a giant, the son of Jupiter and Elara. Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.] [Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver. 27. He was the son of Titan and Terra, and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning, and thrown beneath Mount Ætna. See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii. Ep.ii. 1.11.] [Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver. 28. He evidently alludes to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have imagined.] [Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver. 29. Æolus gave Ulysses favourable wind sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to Ithaca. See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv. 1. 223] [Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver. 32. He calls Philomela the daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been the first king of Athens. Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver. 33. He alludes to the transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.] [Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver. 35. He alludes to the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus. See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.] [Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver. 37. Reference is made to the transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled amber. See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 364.] [Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver. 38. He alludes to the ships of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea Nymphs.] [Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver. 39. Reference is made to the revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have hidden his face.] [Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver. 40. Amphion is said to have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.] [Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver. 2. Marcus Furius Camillus, the Roman general, took the city of Falisci.] [Footnote 665: The covered paths.--Ver. 12. The pipers, or flute players, led the procession, while the ground was covered with carpets or tapestry.] [Footnote 666: Snow-white heifers.--Ver. 14. Pliny the Elder, in his Second Book, says, 'The river Clitumnus, in the state of Falisci, makes those cattle white that drink of its waters.'] [Footnote 667: In the lofty woods.--Ver. 20. It is not known to what occasion this refers. Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her; and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in Egypt and Libya. Perhaps the former occasion is here referred to.] [Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver. 21. This is similar to the alleged origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday. The Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors, the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.] [Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver. 24.

'Favere linguis' seems here to mean, 'to keep religious silence as to the general meaning of the term, see the Fasti, Book i. 1. 71.] [Footnote 672: Halesus.--Ver. 33. Halesus is said to have been the son of Agamemnon, by a concubine. Alarmed at the tragic death of his father, and of the murderers, Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, he fled to Italy, where he founded the city of Phalesus, which title, with the addition of one letter, was given to it after his name. Phalesus afterwards became corrupted, to 'Faliscus,' or 'Falisci.'] [Footnote 673: One side and the other.--Ver. 32. For the 'torus exterior' and 'interior,' and the construction of the beds of the ancients, see the Note to the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 659. Forced to love.--Ver. 39. This passage seems to be hopelessly corrupt.] [Footnote 674: Turning-place is grazed.--Ver. 2. On rounding the 'meta' in the chariot race, from which the present figure is derived, see the Note to the 69th line of the Second Elegy of this Book.] [Footnote 675: Heir to my rank.--Ver. 5. See the Tristia, Book ii. 1. 112, where he enlarges upon the rank and circumstances of his family.] [Footnote 676: To glorious arms.--Ver. 9. He alludes to the Social war which was commenced in the year of the City 659, by the Marsi, the Peligni, and the Picentes, for the purpose of obtaining equal rights and privileges with the Roman citizens. He calls them 'arma honesta,' because wielded in defence of their liberties.] [Footnote 677: Rome dreaded.--Ver. 10. The Romans were so alarmed, that they vowed to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, if their arms should prove successful.] [Footnote 678: Amathusian parent.--Ver. 15. Venus was worshipped especially at Amathus, a city of Cyprus; it is mentioned by Ovid as abounding in metals. See the Metamorphoses, Book x. 1. 220 and 531, B. III.] [Footnote 679: The homed.--Ver. 17. In addition to the reasons already mentioned for Bacchus being represented as horned, it is said, by some, that it arose from the fact, of wine being drunk from horns in the early ages. It has been suggested, that it had a figurative meaning, and implied the violence of those who are overtaken with wine.] [Footnote 680: Lyæus.--Ver. 17. For the meaning of the word Lyæus, see the Metamorphoses, Book iv. 1. 11, and the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 681: My sportive.--Ver. 19. Genialis; the Genii were the Deities of pure, unadorned nature. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1. 58, and the Note to the passage. 'Genialis,' consequently, 'voluptuous,' or 'pleasing to the impulses of nature.'] End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Amores, or Amours, by Ovid", "full_doc_id":
